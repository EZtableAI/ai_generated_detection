For years there has been a lot of controversy about the use of cellular devices while driving. People only tend to do it because they know they wont get caught unless they hold it up where it is visible.  Nobody should be allowed to use a phone while driving for any reason since it is very unsafe .As punishment they should get fined at least 500$ and get a tracker that doesnt let you use your phone while in driving motion.  Windows reflect whatever is on the outside so most of the time you cant see if someone is using a phone while driving. Texting while driving should be prohibited as it is a danger to themselves and to their society. It can lead to a car accident that could potentially get you killed.  1 in 4 accidents is caused by texting and driving making up a little over 300,000 crashes a year.  The minimum fine should be 500$ because eventually it adds up and people will realize that it isnt worth it. The tracker will prevent those who have already been caught texting and driving from using their phone. It will automatically alert the nearest officer. In general you shouldnt even glance at your phone because in a matter of seconds your life can flash right before your eyes. Now youre six feet under just because you wanted to text back or check a notification that wasnt even important and worth making you accidentally take your life.                                                                            
Distance learning, or the utilization of technology-based tools as an alternative to traditional in-person instruction, has become an increasingly popular option in the educational context. Distance learning has the potential to provide students with increased flexibility and autonomy over their learning, such as the ability to work at their own pace or attend to other commitments while still accessing course material. In addition, distance learning makes courses offered by different institutions available to anyone with access to the internet, opening up more learning possibilities.  At the same time, distance learning can be detrimental to some students. Certain students, such as those who do not have consistent access to the internet or reliable technology, may face difficulty in completing their course material in a timely and efficient manner. Furthermore, direct instructions and guidance from teachers can be severely limited in a distance learning environment, which can be problematic for those who require more support in their learning.  Overall, the pros and cons of distance learning must be weighed carefully depending on each individual students learning requirements and situation. Distance learning can be an effective and beneficial form of learning in some contexts, but it can also be limiting and counterproductive in others.
Learning in a classroom setting and in a home setting both have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will compare and contrast these two learning environments to help determine which one is better for students.  One of the biggest advantages of learning in a classroom setting is the opportunity to interact with other students. In a classroom, students are able to collaborate and work together on projects, share ideas, and ask questions. This type of social interaction is essential for students to develop important communication and teamwork skills that will serve them well in the future. Additionally, teachers are able to provide immediate feedback and guidance, which can help students stay on track and improve their understanding of the material.  On the other hand, learning in a home setting allows for more flexibility and personalization. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially beneficial for those who have different learning styles or who struggle with traditional classroom settings. Additionally, students can learn in an environment that is most comfortable for them, which can help them feel more relaxed and focused.  However, one of the main disadvantages of learning in a home setting is the lack of social interaction. In a classroom, students are able to interact with their peers and teachers on a daily basis, which can help them develop important social skills. Additionally, home learning can be isolating, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.  Another disadvantage of home learning is the potential for distractions. In a home setting, students may be distracted by family members, pets, or other household activities. This can make it difficult for them to stay focused and on task. In a classroom, however, students are able to minimize distractions and concentrate on their studies.  In conclusion, both classroom learning and home learning have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. While classroom learning provides opportunities for social interaction and immediate feedback, home learning allows for more flexibility and personalization. Ultimately, the best learning environment for a student will depend on their individual needs and preferences.
The legalization of marijuana has been a hot topic for a while now. Some people think its a good idea, while others dont. In my opinion, marijuana should be legalized.  First of all, marijuana is not a dangerous drug. Its not addictive like other drugs, and it doesnt cause harm to the body. In fact, it has been proven that marijuana has many health benefits. It can help with anxiety, depression, and even some physical illnesses like chronic pain.  Another reason why marijuana should be legalized is that it can be a valuable source of revenue for the government. If marijuana is legalized, the government can tax it and use the money for important things like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This would also create jobs and boost the economy.  Furthermore, criminalizing marijuana has led to a lot of problems. People who are caught with marijuana can face harsh punishments, including jail time. This is not only unfair, but it also costs the government a lot of money to house these people in prisons. If marijuana is legalized, we can avoid these unnecessary expenses and focus on more important things.  Additionally, legalizing marijuana would help to reduce crime. Currently, drug dealers are making a lot of money from selling marijuana illegally. If marijuana is legalized, the government can regulate it and take away the profit from these drug dealers. This would also reduce the number of drug-related crimes.  However, some people argue that marijuana is a gateway drug and that legalizing it would lead to more drug use. But, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. In fact, studies have shown that states where marijuana is legal have not seen an increase in drug use.  In conclusion, marijuana should be legalized. Its a safe drug that has many health benefits, it can be a valuable source of revenue for the government, it would help to reduce crime, and its not a gateway drug. The government should focus on more important things than criminalizing people for using a drug that is not harmful.

 Summer projects are a great way for students to continue learning during their break, and they can be even more effective when designed by the students themselves. By allowing students to take the lead in designing their own projects, they are more likely to be engaged and excited about the work they are doing.  One of the main benefits of student-designed projects is that they are more likely to be fun and engaging for other students. For example, when a student designs a game or activity to help their peers study for an upcoming test, it can be more exciting and enjoyable than a traditional study session. This can help students stay motivated and engaged, which can lead to better learning outcomes.  Another benefit of student-designed projects is that they can be more tailored to the individual needs and interests of each student. When students have the freedom to choose their own project topic, they are more likely to be passionate about the work they are doing. This can lead to more in-depth and meaningful learning experiences.  In addition, student-designed projects can be more effective at helping students develop important skills such as leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving. When students are given the opportunity to take the lead on a project, they are more likely to develop these skills and become more confident and independent learners.  Overall, student-designed projects can be a valuable tool for helping students continue learning during their summer break. By allowing students to take the lead in designing their own projects, they are more likely to be engaged, motivated, and effective learners.
Kids dontÂ always make it to school. They might be sick, sleep in too late, have family issues, or are just on a vacation. To keep on track with their learning some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. This could be useful for students who are sick a lot, are on vacation, or they just couldnt get to school that day.  When students are sick and they have to stay home from school they miss a lot of content that they have to make up without the teachers lesson. A student might get lost and not learn the material correctly because the teacher wasnt there to help them or they just didnt do the work at home. If they had a video lesson from their teacher they would learn the material, do the work along with it, and fill in any notes that they missed from that class period.  Lets say that a student went on vacation in the middle of the year and missed a week of class, they would have to make that all up themselves without the teachers lesson to help or guide them. The student will fall behind immenselyÂ and their grade will drop. The student will eventually fail the  SOLs because they took a vacation and fell behind. The online class will prevent that by helping them while they are gone.  When a student oversleeps they usually have their parent or older sibling drive them to school, but what if they dont have an extra ride to school and just have to miss their classes. The online class would be perfect for a situation like this where they just couldnt make it to school. Also the online class could work for students that dont have a specific class at their school that they want to take, so they can use the online class to take the class from another school.  In the end, online classes could be useful for students that miss a lot of school or just arent there all the time. It could be used for students that cant take a specific class, that are sick for a few days, or just couldnt make it to school on time.
After researching the advantages and disadvantages of extending the school day to two hours for a four-day week, it is the recommendation of this report that the school should extend the school day. The extended school day would provide more time for teachers to complete their syllabi and would reduce the amount of student stress due to shortened test-intensive days. Additionally, students who are working would not have to miss classes and would benefit from better time management skills that would come from the four-day school week. However, the extended school day should come with specific guidelines such as an optional lunch period and alternate modes of instruction to ensure that student engagement and educational goals are not sacrificed.
79% of student have a lot of stress because of school work. My friend, Generic_Name would cry to me because of how much school work he has, how unhappy he is, and how he needs a break. I think students should have an extracurricular we dont need to have 79% of student to be dealing with the stuff Generic_Name is dealing.  One of the reason I think student should have an extracurricular is to help calm stress. If a student does work all day then he or she will be stressed out of how much work they have to do, but if they have a class that they enjoy doing, and doesnt have to do work then they wouldnt be stressed out they would be stress freeÂ . Another reason why I think student should have an extracurricular activity is because more student would show up to school. For example, last year I would always hate odd days so much that I didnt even want to show up to school but there was this one class that kept me from staying home. It was art class I would just enjoy laughing with my friends, finger painting, and drawing people. If I didnt had that class I wouldnt even have shown up to school. I also think if student have an extracurricular they would come back to class all pump up and ready to do work. For example if I had an extracurricular and it was yoga or exercise then I would be ready to go to my class to do some work. They say when you do exercise it pump up blood and flow to your brain which makes them all ready to learn. My final reason why I think student should have an extracurricular activity is because student will have a positive attitude. Have you ever had a student come into your classroom all grumpy and grouchy? Well its most likely because of the period they had before you. I know this because I am a student and Ive been in their shoes before. One day I came home with a bad attitude and my parents would ask me why Im acting bad I would tell them how bad my day was. There are some days that I came home all happy and jump because how amazing and fun my day was. Which is why we should have an extracurricular activity because our parents or teachers shouldnt have to deal with our bad attitude.  I think student should get an extracurricular activity because it will help a lot to lower students stress, it would help get students ready to learn, it would help student have a great attitude, and it will help student show up to school more.Â 
Online Learning  FCPSOn, a program designed to guide the FCPS learning platform to online, was introduced this year when each student was issued a FCPS laptop. The goal with these devices was to eventually move all school work to the computer. This presents the idea of being able to complete the course from out of the classroom. At home online learning is beneficial because; students have the ability to rewatch/reread content, common in classroom distractions are not present, and students can learn when they are most prepared. However, students should go to school twice a week to turn in any work and receive any hands on learning that is needed for the course.  When you dont understand something your first action is to read or watch it again and this often helps you understand it. When you receive a lecture from a teacher and you dont understand it, you can ask questions but chances are you dont know how to or what to ask. When taking an online course you have access to all the information so you know you didnt miss or dont understaand anything.  A class of 25 teenagers is hard to control and chances are not all of them are focused all the time. This leads to wasted time and students not learning the information. However, being at home has its distractions too but, deadlines and live teaching sessions can further motivate students to pay attention. Overall, without the time to switch classes and the learning could be dont faster, the hours spent working on school work in day would be less than seven.  If a student is sick or they miss school and usually have to wait till the next day to get caught up, if all the information and assignments were online students could catch up the same day. If a student doesnt do their work that morning that can complete it later in the day when they are feeling better.  I also believe that it is very important that students come to school twice a week to attend all their classes because, classes in the science and phyiscs field require hands on learning. Although all the learning will be done online physical projects or presentations are important so, on campus class will give a time for students to turn in physical work or present projects to the class.  My proposal is that students are required to be working on their computers at home for 5 hours a day, each class is one hour and fifteen minutes. In this time students are to tune in to a live stream held by the teacher and ask/answer questions during it, after this they can completed assigned work by the end of the period or when the teacher assigns. All the live streams are recorded and students have access to them as well as all the information discussed during it. Two days every week students are required to go to school like normal and this gives them time to turn in any work, present any work or take tests and quizzes.  Overall, online learning at home is beneficial because students have the ability to rewatch/reread content, common in classroom distractions are not present, and students can learn when they are most prepared. Hands on learning is also very important so, twice a week student should attend normal school and turn in any physical work and receive hands on learning. I believe this provides the perfect balance for efficient learning.   Â  Â  Â 
Dear principal,  I agree with policy number 1 because it gives students the use of their cell phones if they need to use them. I also agree with it because then students would not be tempted to use their phone during class or when the teacher is talking, giving them more time to focus on their schoolwork. Another reason that policy 1 is better is sometimes the students need to use their cell phones in case there is some kind of emergency and the student needs to be contacted by someone like family or friend.  I strongly agree that the students shouldnt be using their cell phones during the school day because a teacher could be talking when they are using their phone, which would be distracting to some of the other students that are paying attention. Also the students would get bad grades because they pay more attention to the cell phones than there teacher. The students should get to use phones but only if there is a designated time, emergency, or if during a lunch period. However many students that dont have a cell phone could or would be distracted by those who do and wouldnt pay attention to their teachers, work, and class.  Policy 2 also prevents kids from having freedom of when they can and cant do certain things, which would make the students want to use the phones even more because they are not given the option to. Students would also think they could use the cell phones because they were told they cant. That is why I would say policy number 1 would be the right one to choose so you dont have the students using the phones whenever they want and you could have more paying attention in class. Also with more work getting done in the class you would have less of the kids getting in trouble or disrupting the class. and it would give the kids something to look forward to in school.      
Productive people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates have achieved great success through their dedication, hard work, and responsibility. In order to achieve success, it is essential to prioritize getting enough sleep, being responsible, and working hard. Additionally, being inactive can be detrimental to achieving success, and even small steps can lead to bigger accomplishments. In this essay, I will explore these factors and provide my opinion on how accomplishing more is possible with effort.  Firstly, getting enough sleep is crucial in achieving success. It allows the brain to function properly and increases productivity. Without enough sleep, it is difficult to focus and make decisions effectively. Steve Jobs was known for his long work hours and lack of sleep, which ultimately led to his early death. Bill Gates, on the other hand, prioritized his health and made sure to get enough sleep, which contributed to his long-term success.  Secondly, responsibility is a key factor in achieving success. It involves taking ownership of ones actions and being accountable for the results. Steve Jobs was responsible for the success of Apple and was known for his attention to detail and commitment to quality. Bill Gates was responsible for the development of Microsoft and was known for his focus on innovation and customer satisfaction.  Thirdly, working hard is essential in achieving success. It involves consistently putting in effort and dedication towards ones goals. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates both worked tirelessly to achieve their success, and it is clear that their hard work paid off.  However, being inactive can be detrimental to achieving success. Exercise and physical activity can improve mental and physical health, which in turn can increase productivity and motivation. Steve Jobs was known for his love of exercise and would often take long walks to clear his mind and come up with new ideas. Bill Gates also prioritized exercise and made sure to incorporate it into his daily routine.  Lastly, even small steps can lead to bigger accomplishments. It is important to set realistic goals and take incremental steps towards achieving them. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates both started with small ideas and built upon them to create something much bigger. For example, Steve Jobs started with the idea of a personal computer and built upon it to create the Macintosh, which revolutionized the industry.  In conclusion, achieving success requires prioritizing
Everyone has a role in the community: such as citizens , mayors , senators , or even presidents. These high roles are selected by the citizens within the community. Some people have a technique of who they vote for but everyone follow the same system, the Electoral College. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. - souce 1 . The Electoral College gives citizens that meet the criteria a chase to vote.  The Electoral College is a system use for citizens to pick who they would like to make and force the laws. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congess.- Source 1. Its many steps to picking a president. You have to pick candidates and those candidates have their share of electors, which are chosen by a political party under certain qualifications. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are . . . . -source 1.  The Electoral College has many flaws that can happen but is unlikely to happen. The citizens really dont vote for the president, they put they trust in an electors hand to choose the right President. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed). . .-Source 3. Its unlikely for the trust to be betrayed but it has happened during the Gore vs. Bush campaign in 2000. The Electoral College, despite its lack of democratic history, have five practical reasons for retaining- Certainty of Outcome, the President chosen becomes everyone president, some states are swing states, some are big states, and they try to avoid run-off elections.  At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.-source 2. While others may want to get rid of the Electoral College due to the unfairness it brings, others may feel different and would like to keep it going due to it given the citizens a choice. You help choose your states electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidatess electors.-Source 1.  Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political prefereance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .-source 3. The electoral college should continue to help citizens vote for campaign runners role in the community because it provides the citizens a choice and also a voice. A vote may not change a election but every vote will count and make a difference.       Â Â Â Â     
I disagree with the school board because we not trying be in school more time in school. Also students need to have their own time outside of school with family and friends. I also think this because students spent 8hrs in school more than what they spend at home. My other idea is that i think the schools around that county should have a essay in all schools asking students about how they feel about this decision. The county should take the students decision as a answer about what they think because our ideas matter too. Also the school should be thinking about the students benefits of being in school for longer and for less not just to one side. I think if they did that they point of view will change a lot knowing what students think also it would help them know about what students they are dealing with that would be a great advantage for them. That would help them with the decision and knowing what would be the impact on the students. This is my prompt to yall about if i agree or disagree.
The accomplishments of Mahatma Gandhi, Bill Gates, and Nelson Mandela all demonstrate that hard work and dedication can lead to success. Mahatma Gandhi fought for Indias independence through peaceful protests and civil disobedience, which eventually resulted in Indias independence in 1947. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University to form Microsoft, growing it into the largest software company in the world. Nelson Mandela successfully campaigned to end the apartheid system and introduce democracy in South Africa.   Thomas Jeffersons quote Im a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it speaks to the idea that hard work can lead to success. This has been exemplified by these individuals, and is evidence that setting goals and working diligently to achieve them can lead to a successful outcome.
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, âTo be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.â As Iâve grown older, Iâve come to appreciate and understand the essence of his wise words. Being yourself allows you to have a sense of confidence and comfort in yourself, and makes it easier to express and share your ideas with others. It helps us develop and become better people by allowing us to gain knowledge and experiences in life.   We often face pressure to conform or fit into certain social roles or expectations, and, while it may be easier to simply comply with the status quo, there is nothing quite like finding the courage and inner peace that comes from being yourself, regardless of what society thinks. Accepting ourselves and who we are is one of the most important steps we can take in life.   Overall, Emersonâs words are as relevant today as ever. We all need to be reminded from time to time why it is so important to be ourselves and to realize the greatness that exists within all of us. Despite the challenges that may come our way, by being true to ourselves, we can find true happiness.
The use of technology that is able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be very valuable. There would be a number of benefits if there was such technology availiable. This technology would not only benefit the students in more ways than one.  If schools had technology that could read the faces of students and modify the lessons, it would increase the students chances of success. In the article, Dr. Huang claims, A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. If the lesson was altered to improve the facial expression of the student, there is a huge chance that the student will become more engaged in the lesson, resulting in success. When a student is bored in a lesson, it is more than likely the student will not pay as much attention to it as well as they would if they were truly interested. Confusion may cause frustration which would lead to a more difficult learning process.  A student who is actually interested in a certain lesson has more of a chance to become excited about the lesson, making the learning experience more enjoyable and easier to learn. In the article, Dr. Huang says, Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. This being said, most students will more than likely not verbaly express when they dislike a certain lesson. Most would show their unhappiness through facial expressions. Because a teacher may not be able to fully read a students facial expression, it would be more effective if computers were availiable to read the expressions and alter the lesson for the student.  Technology that is able to read the facial expressions of a student would benefit the student and the teachers. The student would be more engaged in the lesson, and the teacher would have a better understanding of what grabs the attention of his or her students compared to what drives his or her students away. The new technolgy would make a students more confident their skills, leading to a better, more successful educational system.    
Dear Principal,  The policy I believe is better is Policy 1 because if students actually pay attention in class they should get some time to talk to there friends by text or by calling them and asking them how has there day been and talk about any problems they have been having at all in the day. To me policy 1 is the best choice to go with because nothing wrong is happening as long as they text or talk about good things and not bad things in class or outside of class, but the phones should not be turned on in class at all times.  If students get the chance to text at school in lunchtime they should earn it as long as they behave good. The phones shouldnt be turned on while in class because then it would get in the way of there studying and their class work also. To me policy 1 is the best way to go, policy 2 is not the best way to go with because what if an emergency or some other thing happened how will they contact you or you contact your parents. That is one reason another reason is students have the authority to be able to use there phone, why cant they I know it gets in the way of there class work but they might need it some day in the future in case of an emergency. But there phone also gets in the way of there studying and of there work so that is the backside to it, but students should be able to use there phones no matter what happens.  Policy too says that phones are not allowed at school, that is not a good thing students should be able to have there phones with them but turned off thats easy that is what the principal should have done in the fist place or they couldve also told students to bring there phones have them turned on only answer emergency calls, and be able to answer them but not text or call your friends while at school, that is another policy that could have been done but since those arent policies than policy 1 is the best policy to go with.  Policy 2 is not the best policy because why shouldnt students be able have phones with them at school, they should be able too, they have the right, nobody can say that they cant have phones with them or bring phones to school. The students have the right nobody can say that they cant bring phones, whoever says that does not know what they are talking about. Students should be able to bring phones and text there friends because they just want to talk and hang out with them, what is that wrong to do, I say no because it is just there friends, nothing is wrong with that. Students should be able to bring phones to school and have them turned off during class but on during lunch, nutrition, break, and between going to your next class.  Policy 1 is the best policy to go with because students get to use there cell phones at school , and in policy 2 students do no get the chance to bring them or to use them. That to me is not a cool policy because students should get the chance to use phones at school.      
The author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I think this for multiple reasons. Yes NASA may have a possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus which could allow scientists to float above the fray, but you dont know for sure if it would work or if you would make it back alive. Why take the chance? I know I wouldnt.  In the atricle the author states Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. This would mean that you couldnt really experiment anything you find there and it would be pointless to even go to Venus. To be able to study Venus like they want they would need evidence and samples of different objects from there. The article also states Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standards forms of photography and videography ineffective. This would mean that you would need to stay so far away and even when being that far the pictures or videos you would want to take could not be done. Also with additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface makes the chances more slim to surving on Venus for even a few short hours.  In conclusion, I would not say studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is the second planet from our sun which is why its proved to be a very challenging place to examine more closely. Especially since no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. Trying to go to Venus would be pointless and not worth it. Not only are clouds in Venus challenging which are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere, but a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. It would be way too dangerous to go there. Even despite the dangers you dont know if the bimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape is even reliable.
Working in groups or working alone has been a common topic of debate among students, professionals, and educators. While some people argue that working alone is more effective, others believe that working in groups is more beneficial. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of working in groups compared to working alone, identify the advantages and disadvantages of each, describe the importance of communication, goals, and respect when working in a group, reflect on personal experience, and evaluate how it can help an individual in the real world.  Working in groups has several advantages over working alone. Firstly, working in a group allows for the exchange of ideas and perspectives. When people work together, they can share their thoughts and opinions, leading to better decision-making and problem-solving. Secondly, working in groups can increase productivity and efficiency. When people work together, they can divide the workload and complete tasks more quickly. Thirdly, working in groups can improve communication skills. When people work together, they must communicate effectively to achieve their goals, leading to better communication skills.  On the other hand, working alone has several advantages over working in groups. Firstly, working alone allows for more focus and concentration. When people work alone, they can work at their own pace and without distractions, leading to better productivity. Secondly, working alone allows for more control over the work. When people work alone, they have more control over the work, leading to better quality work. Thirdly, working alone allows for more flexibility. When people work alone, they can work on their own schedule and in their own style, leading to better work-life balance.  However, working in groups also has some disadvantages. Firstly, working in groups can lead to conflicts and disagreements. When people work together, they have different opinions and ideas, leading to conflicts. Secondly, working in groups can be less efficient than working alone. When people work together, they must communicate and coordinate, leading to less efficient work. Thirdly, working in groups can be less productive than working alone. When people work together, they may not work at their best, leading to less productive work.  Working alone also has some disadvantages. Firstly, working alone can lead to isolation and loneliness. When people work alone, they may feel isolated and lonely, leading to mental health issues. Secondly, working alone can be
 The debate surrounding extracurricular activities and their role in a students life is ongoing. While some argue that schools should have more control over a students involvement in extracurricular activities, I believe that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families.  Firstly, students should be given the freedom to choose their extracurricular activities based on their interests and passions. By allowing students to choose their own activities, they are more likely to be engaged and committed to their involvement. This can lead to a more meaningful and fulfilling experience for the student.  Secondly, students should be given the opportunity to balance their extracurricular activities with their academic responsibilities. By allowing students to choose their own activities, they can choose activities that fit their schedule and do not interfere with their academic performance. This can help reduce stress and improve their overall academic performance.  Thirdly, students should be given the opportunity to take ownership of their extracurricular involvement. By allowing students to choose their own activities, they are more likely to take ownership of their involvement and feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. This can help them develop important life skills such as responsibility, leadership, and teamwork.  In conclusion, the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families. By allowing students to choose their own activities, balance their involvement with their academic responsibilities, and take ownership of their involvement, they can have a more meaningful and fulfilling experience. It is important for schools to consider the impact of controlling students involvement in extracurricular activities on their overall well-being and success.
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  From my stance, I think that students shouldnt be required to perform community service. Sure, some students may want to, so they can if they would like. Other students may find that they do not want to, or do not have the time to.  If every student was assigned to do hours of community service, some may not be satisfied with this. For instance, all of the homework and projects that students are assigned is enough on their plate already after going to school for 6 hours. Some students may have practice, or possibly a game, to go to. Others may have a part-time job working somewhere, and would need the time when they get home to relax and finish up their homework. Every student has a busy schedule outside of school, and may not be able to fulfill their hours of community service.  Other students may not want to do community service. I mean, you shouldnt blame them; they are just kids. They need to have some freedom outside of school. Most students, in general, would be glad to get home from school, maybe take a nap, or go on the computer. Adding homework plus community service after school would just be very stressful to them. In order to function well during the day, students will need all of the sleep they can get. Nowadays, students are not able to get the minimum amount of sleep.  You may be coming to the idea that it is the students fault for not being able to have time after school, and maybe in some cases it is. But that is how they are living their lives; its their lifestyle. If they continue living like that, it is because its how they mange their day. You cant just take away their joy, change how they live, and give them more duties; it would just make them even more stressed. As I had said before, theyre only children. They cannot handle so much work and not enough freedom.  In other cases, some students may want to participate in giving community service. Those students possibly have more time on their hands, so doing something for the community is a good way to spend it.  Maybe a better solution would be to set up a club or organization for community service. Let those kids have the option open to them. Rewarding the students in the organization for their efforts would be an easier way to go so everyone is satisfied.  If you are not contented with the idea above, then you could ask some students to give their services on weekends. They have more time then, since it is a break off from school. Community service on weekends can possibly mean that more students would be able to participate, and the community would also be benefited.  I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my letter. I hope that some of the information in here has guided you into a direction of proclaiming your decision. If you do not go with any of the ideas I have suggested, I hope that you have found some useful information that I have provided throughout my letter.  Thank You,  STUDENT_NAME

As an eighth-grade student, it is important to be prepared for life-threatening situations. In such situations, it is crucial to know what to do and how to act to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you. In this essay, I will discuss what to do in three common life-threatening situations: lockdowns, fire drills, and earthquakes. Additionally, I will provide strategies for staying safe in life-threatening situations with five high school grade students.  Firstly, in the event of a lockdown, it is important to identify suitable objects to throw at an intruder. While it may seem counterintuitive, throwing objects can be an effective way to deter an intruder and give yourself time to escape. Some suitable objects to throw include books, chairs, or even your backpack. However, it is important to note that throwing objects should only be done as a last resort and only if it is safe to do so. Additionally, it is important to have a plan in place for escaping the lockdown, such as knowing which doors or windows to use and how to signal for help.  Secondly, in the event of a fire drill, it is important to know how to act. Fire drills are designed to help you and your school be prepared for a real fire. During a fire drill, you should follow the instructions of your schools fire alarm, which will usually involve leaving the building through the nearest exit. It is important to stay calm and move quickly, as time is of the essence. Additionally, it is important to know where the nearest fire extinguisher is located and how to use it if necessary.  Lastly, in the event of an earthquake, it is important to know what to do. Earthquakes can be unpredictable and can occur at any time. During an earthquake, it is important to drop to the ground, cover your head and neck with your arms, and hold on until the shaking stops. It is also important to stay inside until the shaking stops, as aftershocks can occur. Additionally, it is important to have a plan in place for what to do in case of an earthquake, such as knowing where to take cover and how to signal for help.  In conclusion, it is important to be prepared for life-threatening situations. By identifying suitable objects to
Making our own decisions and following our own instincts can be a powerful tool for leading a successful and fulfilling life. By having agency over our choices, we can better face the consequences, good or bad, of our decisions. Knowing we are the masters of our own fate allows us to be more mindful of the steps we take and to be intentional with the outcomes we pursue. Taking charge of our lives can also mean ignoring other peoples opinions and expectations. Choosing to march to the beat of our own drum can be liberating, and give us the opportunity to explore who we truly are. Making our own decisions and following our instincts can open us up to a world of possibilities, enabling us to make the most of our lives.
Imagine what it would be like to use technology to identify human emotions? The article, Making Mona Lisa Smile informs us of a new method that might be beneficial for teachers. Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has used improved technology to help establish a connection between computers and how they are able to detect human emotions. Another man, by the name of Prof. Thomas Huang, has developed a software, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Using computers to help read the emotional expressions of students could be very valuable for teaching and improving education all around the world.  Before learning about the benifits of how computers can detect emotions, its significant to grasp how the system works. The process begins when a computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All forty-four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Moreover, each of the emotions, he claims, are associated with characteristic movements of facial muscles.  On the other hand, Dr. Huang claims that computers can even detect emotional communication when it is nonverbal. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. His claim seems appealing because its important for teachers to help their students succeed. However, students periodically become unfocused, confused, and tired throughout the school day. Thats where advanced computers come into play.  Overall, it would be in the best interest of teachers and community schools to upgrage to advanced methods of teaching, involving computers that detect human emotions. Not only would it be beneficial to students, but it would also improve the knowledge of generations and generations. The general public would be brilliant and could do incredible things. They would be able to cure what are now considered uncurable diseases, improve the standard of living, and find answers to environmental problems such as global warming. 
Learning new things can be uncomfortable, but it doesnt have to be that way. In fact, there are many ways to make learning more comfortable, and practical examples of how people have used new skills to accomplish something significant can help motivate us to keep going. Additionally, working together with others on bigger projects can make the process more enjoyable and productive. However, not doing something can have serious consequences, so its important to recognize the importance of asking for help when needed.  One way to make learning more comfortable is to break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of trying to learn everything at once, we can focus on one topic at a time and gradually build our knowledge. This can be especially helpful when learning something new, as it allows us to focus on one concept without getting overwhelmed.  Another way to make learning more comfortable is to find a study group or partner to work with. Working with others can provide a sense of community and support, and can also help us stay motivated and accountable. Plus, it can be more fun to learn with someone else!  Practical examples of how people have used new skills to accomplish something significant can be very inspiring. For instance, many successful entrepreneurs have learned new skills in order to start and grow their businesses. They may have learned how to code, how to market their products, or how to manage finances. By using these new skills, they were able to turn their ideas into reality and achieve great success.  Working together with others on bigger projects can also be very beneficial. When we work with others, we can combine our strengths and skills to create something greater than any one person could have done alone. Plus, it can be more fun to work with others and learn from their experiences.  However, not doing something can have serious consequences. For example, not studying for an exam can result in poor grades, which can affect our future opportunities. Similarly, not learning new skills can limit our ability to grow and succeed in our personal and professional lives.  Finally, its important to recognize the importance of asking for help when needed. No one can learn everything on their own, and its okay to ask for help when we need it. Whether its from a teacher, a mentor, or a friend, asking for help can be a sign of strength and a willingness to learn.  In
Cars are becoming a must in todays society. In some places, people live and survive without a motorized vehical. People dont have to stop using cars altogether, but should be able to limit themselves to save of world from pollution creating a better environment to live in.  Some people dont understand the severity of pollution and how much cars contribute to that. Pollution is said to become Earths demise, whith cars producing and letting out so much smog, it seems as if the Earths demise could be near. According to Robert Duffer, Paris has enfored a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. This evidence of Paris giving a partial ban shows how detrimental cars can have on Earth environment. Further examination reveals, a situtation where Bogota has even issued a  car-free day stated by Andrew Selsky. This source shows us that with even one day without using a car could be a useful plan for all places. People of today dont need to not use their cars, just use their cars either less per day or per week.  Although some may say, we need cars to get to work or to go to the grocery store, they can always just use public transportation. Buses are already running even if you are in a car so why not use them instead of polluting the air even more. In Bogota, when they have their car-free day, most people either hiked,biked, skated or took buses as a mean of transportation. More evidence shows a senario where the Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging a car reduced community, stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Resources such as this one shows that if the United States Evironmental Protection Agency is concerned about our pollution rate why shouldnt we? If we cut down on our use of cars, pollution rate can drop extremley down causing a better living environment.  When you stop to think why cars have become so prevelant, there is no exact reasoning. If we dont even know our exact reasoning for having a car, in a case that we cant rely on buses or our own two legs to provided why are we risking the safty of our Earth in order to use them? Cars arent the slighest bit the problem, how and how often we use them is becoming the problem, if we limit our use of cars our advantage would be the single best thing in live, happiness and peace of life.

So when Luke came back to China he saw even more homeless people than before. So he thought he would have to make a change to that.  So when he was setting up a program for conviencing people to help the homeless Don tried to call and have him come to America and and Luke said, Don, I cant I have to help the people in China because I see little kids and grown people starving on the street and that hurts me. So then when he had it set up a lot of people came to support it and Luke convienced a lot of people, but also a lot of people not to help. So the applications to sign up there was a fee of ten dollars to help with the grocceries and that was why even more people did not join him.  So when he saw a lot of people without forms he stopped everybody and had a long speech about helping the poor and imagine if you were in their shoes and telling them they didnt want to be like that. So then almost all the people clapped and then walked in and got a form and asked him where to start. He said, Just if you see a homeless person, help him out. So then after he rode his boat to America and helped Don out he came back to China to see how his SeaGoing Cowboys program was going.  When he came to China he was very happy of how everybody had a house and job and nobody was starving. So he set up a meeting and thanked everybody who supported that program and told them they did a wonderful job and he almost cired of how much he was happy.  So when he rode his boat back to his home town he told Don and Lukes family about what happened and they said they should do that in America and they did and it worked out just as great as China. His program became national because how good it was and he said it was all the people who helped out he said, What I love about it was that they didnt have to do but how they did, it just makes me warm inside and very happy. So just seeing homeless people on the street made and making a program had this much of a bennifit. Luke felted great about what he did.
 Life is a valuable asset, and those who value self-reliance believe that each individual should follow their own path in life. Experiencing life firsthand is a good way to improve ones life, and people who work hard and strive to be the best version of themselves are more likely to achieve their goals in the future.  Some people take a more relaxed approach to life, not putting in any effort and simply buying what they want. However, this approach can lead to a lack of fulfillment and a lack of control over ones life.  Many people follow a famous persons life, reading their books or watching their videos, hoping to gain some insight into how to improve their own lives. While this can be a helpful approach, its important to remember that everyones life is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another.  Its essential to help others and make a positive impact on the world, whether its through volunteering, donating to charity, or simply being a good person. By doing so, we can help create a better future for ourselves and others.  Some people may want to be a hero or a successful businessperson, but their lives may not be fulfilling if theyre not living in accordance with their values. Its important to take responsibility for our own lives and make decisions that align with our goals and beliefs.  Smart people follow a famous persons life, striving to improve their own lives and make a positive impact on the world. By reading books and gaining knowledge about life, they can make informed decisions and take action to achieve their goals.  In conclusion, life is important to me, and everyone should strive to make a positive impact on the world. Whether its through hard work, volunteering, or simply being a good person, we can all make a difference in our own lives and the lives of others.
A lot of schools in America require students to do summer projects to make sure they are exercising their knowledge during the 3 month break, some schools believe they should let the students choose the projectÂ they are going to complete, some schools believe they should let the teachers decide what the students will do.  I believe the students should decide what the project will be, because the summer should be a time where students are taking their break off from school, so the teachers might give the students a really hard and long project that takes a lot of effort to do not knowing how it feels like, so i believe the school should get ideas for what project they will be giving out to the students from the students, choose their favorites from that list so the students dont pick something that is too easy and gives them barely any knowledge out of it, and then let the students vote for what they want to do.  An example of this is at a school in Dubai, where they placed a closed box in every class and let everybody get a peice of paper, write their idea down, fold it and then put the folded peice of paper inside the box,than they open all of these boxes and pick 50 different prompts, then they make a survey and make every student vote for what they want to do out of these 50 different prompts, the one with the most votes gets chosen.  In conclusion, every school should let the students control some of the decisions made, it gives them more freedom and makes them feel like they have a say on whats going on in their lives instead of letting other people decide for them.
If the school principal wants to change the cell phone rules , then i think it would be a better idea that she lets the students have cell phones at their lunch period and other free time but make them shut the phones off in class. I think thats better because the students already bring in phones and use then during class while the teacher isnt looking or not paying attention. But , if the principal lets the students use their cell phones at lunch or free time in school then they wont have to hide anything from the teacher and be sneaky , some students do do that and if they get caught , they get in a lot of trouble. If the rule is NOT to use the cell phones then i dont get why they do it anyway , there isnt even ever anytime to text someone while in class because the teachers always keep us all busy. If one of the students get caught , you have to tell your parent to go up to the school and go get it. I would find it fair and better if the principal let us use our phones in school , just not in class. I always get in trouble for taking my phone out when i get OUT of school just because Im still on the school grounds. They dont do anything about anyone taking their phones out after school if they see you they just ask you nicely to not use it or put it away while on school grounds.  If it was an emergency Im sure they would let you use your phone or any phone. I dont think the principal would never give you a hard time about your phone being out on school grounds if it was an emergency or something important. But , from my opinion , it think it would be a better idea to just let the students use their phones in their free time. I think all the students would be very happy with that and agree with it , that way they dont have to get in trouble for texting and being accused of being a bad kid because they were texting in class. Thats no fair if you get in trouble but mean while if you have free time why not use your phones while you can.?
 The Importance of Maintaining a Balanced School Schedule  -  Generic_Name  The education system plays a crucial role in shaping the future of individuals and society as a whole. It is essential that schools provide students with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their personal and professional lives. However, there has been a growing trend towards increasing the school day beyond the traditional 7 hours. While the intention behind this may be to provide students with more opportunities to learn and grow, there are several reasons why I believe that maintaining a balanced school schedule is crucial.  Firstly, the current school schedule already provides 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, which is sufficient for most students. Students enter the building and have ample time to attend their classes, complete their assignments, and engage in extracurricular activities. Adding more hours to the school day could lead to overloading students with too much information and not enough time to process it effectively. This could result in decreased academic performance and increased stress levels.  Secondly, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities when the school day is extended. For example, they may struggle to find time to complete their homework or participate in extracurricular activities. Additionally, they may feel overwhelmed by the increased workload and pressure to perform well in school. This could lead to decreased motivation, increased absenteeism, and even dropout rates.  Finally, the addition of one and a half hours to the school day could lead to conflicts with faculty, student, and guardian time frames. For example, students may have extracurricular activities that require adequate time to function properly, such as sports or music. Parents and guardians may struggle to find time to spend with their children and may need to adjust their work schedules to accommodate the longer school day. Faculty members may also need to stay longer to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties, which could lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction.  In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to increasing the school day, I believe that maintaining a balanced schedule is crucial for the well-being of students, faculty, and society as a whole. The current 7-hour school day provides ample time for students to learn and grow, and any additional hours should be carefully considered to avoid overloading students and causing negative consequences. It is important
Japan, the land of the rising sun, is a country that is steeped in culture, technology, and tradition. As an 8th grader, I find myself fascinated by the unique customs and practices of this far-off land. In this essay, I will delve into the various aspects of Japanese society, from its rich culture to its cutting-edge technology, and explore the reasons why Japan is a must-visit destination for any traveler.  Firstly, Japan is renowned for its vibrant culture, which is reflected in its traditional festivals, music, and art. For instance, the Cherry Blossom Festival, or Hanami, is a time-honored tradition that attracts millions of tourists every year. The festival celebrates the blooming of cherry blossoms, which symbolize the fleeting nature of life and the beauty of nature. Similarly, the countrys traditional music, such as the koto and shamisen, are deeply rooted in its history and are still performed today with great passion and skill.  Next, Japan is a leader in technology, with innovative companies like Sony, Toshiba, and Honda revolutionizing the global market. The countrys focus on research and development has led to the creation of cutting-edge products, from smartphones to high-speed trains. Visitors to Japan can experience the latest technology firsthand by visiting the countrys many museums and exhibitions.  Food is another aspect of Japanese culture that is not to be missed. From sushi to ramen, Japan is home to some of the most delicious and unique cuisine in the world. Visitors can sample traditional dishes like tempura, yakitori, and tonkatsu, or try more modern creations like gyoza and okonomiyaki. And for those with a sweet tooth, Japan has a wide variety of desserts, including mochi and manju.  Crime rate in Japan is very low, making it a safe destination for tourists. According to the Japanese National Police Agency, the countrys crime rate has been steadily decreasing over the past few decades, with a rate of 1,557.6 per 100,000 people in 2020. This is
Ummm, hey there!  So, like, community service is totes important for keeping our city clean and safe, you know?   First of all, lets talk about why community service is even a thing.  Like, its not just something our teachers make us do because theyre mean (although, lets be real, some of them can be pretty strict). No, community service is actually a way for us to give back to our community and make it a better place for everyone.   For example, have you ever seen the trash and litter on the streets?  Its gross, right?! But when we do community service, we can help clean up the streets and make sure our city looks nice and tidy.  And not only that, but it also helps keep our city safe!   Like, think about it. When theres less trash on the streets, its less likely for animals to get hurt or for people to get sick from touching gross things.  And when our city looks nice, it makes us feel good too!  Its like, were taking care of our home and making sure its a place where we all want to be.   Plus, when we do community service, were also showing other people that we care about our community and that were willing to work together to make it better.  Its like, were all in this together, you know?  And when we work together, we can accomplish so much more than we could on our own.   So, in conclusion, community service is super important for keeping our city clean and safe.  Its not just something we have to do, its something we should want to do!  And who knows, maybe one day well be the ones organizing community service events and making our city an even better place!  Thanks for reading, I guess!
I belive that driverless cars are a good idea. Personaly, I dont trust people on the roads. People get distracted easily, can have slow reaction times, and sometimes just are not safe. Driverless cars can fix all these problems easily.  One issue is that people easily get distracted. Smart cars, on the otherhand, are complety built for the purpose of diving and analizing the roads. The feature most appealing to me and that fixes this issue is found here in the passage,  Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings..  The second issue with drivers in cars are the drivers reaction times being to slow. Some people just do not have the reactions to be able to use the breaks fast enough to avoid accidents. These cars do it instantly, as stated in the passage,  The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from ethe engine, allowing far bettter response and control than a human driver could manage alone..  Finaly, sometimes people just are not safe. Doing anything from texting while driving or taking erratic turns without signal can be extreamly dangerous to themselfs or anyone around them. These cars can prevent that by even forcing people to watch the road constantly or alerting us when danger is ahead.  GM has developed drivers seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.. This is only one of many safty enhancing developments to smart cars and the protection of the driver.  In conclution, smart cars are a great idea. With these cars people will be safer than ever. No more driver error, distraction, slow reactions, or danger to themselfs or to others around thm.
Sure, heres my essay on the benefits of extracurricular activities for 8th graders:  Extracurricular activities are a crucial part of a students life. They not only provide a break from the rigors of academics, but also offer a range of benefits that can improve grades, health, and overall well-being. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of extracurricular activities on improving grades, the importance of spending time with friends after school, how doing sports can help students both educationally and health-wise, why parents should be interested in their childrens extra-curricular activities, and the long-term effects of extracurricular activities on students.  Firstly, extracurricular activities can significantly improve grades. Studies have shown that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have better academic performance compared to those who do not. This is because extracurricular activities help students develop time management skills, which are essential for balancing schoolwork and other activities. Additionally, extracurricular activities can help students develop a growth mindset, which can lead to improved academic performance. For example, a student who participates in a sports team may learn to persevere through challenges and setbacks, which can translate to improved academic performance.  Secondly, spending time with friends after school is important for mental health and well-being. Extracurricular activities provide an opportunity for students to connect with their peers and make new friends. This can help reduce stress and anxiety, which are common among students. Moreover, spending time with friends can help students develop social skills, such as communication and teamwork, which are essential for success in all areas of life.  Thirdly, doing sports can have numerous benefits for students both educationally and health-wise. Participating in sports can help students develop physical fitness, which is essential for overall health. Regular exercise can also improve cognitive function, memory, and concentration, which can lead to better academic performance. Moreover, sports can help students develop discipline and responsibility, which are essential for success in any area of life.  Fourthly, parents should be interested in their childrens extra-curricular activities because they can provide a range of benefits for their children. Extracurr
Community service is super important to the community. Like, really important. Its like, how can we expect to have a good society if we dont help each other out? I mean, think about it, if everyone just focused on themselves and didnt do anything to help others, the world would be a total mess.  One reason why community service is so important is because it helps people in need. Like, if theres a natural disaster or something, community service can help provide food, shelter, and other necessities to people who are affected. Its like, theyre not alone in their time of need, you know? And its not just during natural disasters, community service can help people who are struggling with everyday things too, like homelessness or hunger.  Another reason why community service is important is because it brings people together. Like, when people come together to help others, it creates a sense of community and belonging. Its like, were all in this together, you know? And its not just about helping others, its about building relationships and connections with the people around us.  For example, my school does a lot of community service projects, like volunteering at a local food bank or cleaning up a nearby park. And its not just the students who are involved, teachers and parents are too! Its like, everyone comes together to make a difference. And its not just about the act of volunteering, its about the impact it has on the community. Like, when we volunteer at the food bank, were helping to feed families who might not have enough food otherwise. Its like, were making a real difference in peoples lives.  And the impact of community service doesnt just stop at the local level. Like, when we do community service projects, were also contributing to the bigger picture. Were showing that we care about our community and that were willing to work together to make it a better place. Its like, were setting an example for others to follow.  So, in conclusion, community service is super important to the community. It helps people in need, brings people together, and has a real impact on the community. So, lets
 When it comes to seeking advice or assistance, its always a good idea to consult with more than one person. This is because different perspectives and experiences can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of a situation and provide valuable insights that might not have been considered otherwise.  One of the main benefits of seeking advice from multiple sources is that it can help to validate or challenge your own ideas and assumptions. When multiple people provide the same piece of advice, its more likely that its correct and based on sound reasoning. On the other hand, if you receive conflicting advice, its important to consider the motivations and biases of each source and try to determine which one is most credible and relevant to your situation.  Another advantage of seeking advice from multiple sources is that it can help to broaden your understanding of a topic or issue. For example, if youre working on a project or writing an essay, seeking advice from experts in different fields can help you to develop a more nuanced and informed perspective on the topic. This can help you to identify potential gaps in your knowledge and develop a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.  In addition to providing valuable insights and broadening your understanding, seeking advice from multiple sources can also help you to build a network of contacts and resources. This can be particularly helpful if youre looking for job opportunities or need assistance with a specific project or task. By building relationships with people who have expertise in your area of interest, you can gain access to valuable resources and opportunities that might not have been available otherwise.  Overall, seeking advice from multiple sources can be a valuable tool for personal and professional growth. By considering different perspectives and experiences, you can develop a more comprehensive understanding of a situation and gain valuable insights that can help you to make informed decisions and achieve your goals.
Do i think we should use this technology on students? Yes i think we should use this technology on students beacause then you might be able to prent fight suicide and more. Ithink its valuable because, if a student is going through a rough time and you use this program you would be able to fidout whats wrong and try to help them.  The other reason why it would be valuable is beause you can help students with bullyin to help them fom getting hurt and not wanting to continue their education due to mean people and neglagence. On top of that we can find out so much me about ur emotions if we were to san teenage minds going through adolesence because they are hanging constantly.  Therefore scanning our emotions will help us find out so much about the human phycological aspect with our emotions. With emotions once we figure out what makes up emotions we will probably mak a robot that can think and feel like a human.  See now the reason why itwouldnt be a good idea is beause it could stress the kids out and make their time worse in schools and in the public life.

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that students with a C average or lower should be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school. While it is important for students to maintain a certain level of academic performance, it is also important to recognize that not all students are able to achieve a B average.  Firstly, it is important to consider the fact that students with a C average or lower may be doing their best to pass their classes. It is possible that they are struggling with certain subjects or facing personal challenges that make it difficult for them to maintain a higher grade. By allowing these students to participate in sports and other activities, we can provide them with an opportunity to develop other skills and interests outside of the classroom.  Secondly, it is important to recognize that students with a C average or lower may not be able to participate in sports and other activities if they are required to maintain a B average. This can be particularly problematic for students who are already struggling academically, as it may be even more difficult for them to meet both the academic and extracurricular requirements.  Finally, it is important to consider the fact that students who do not meet the B average requirement would still be able to experience activities outside of the classroom. This means that they will still have the opportunity to develop social skills, teamwork, and leadership skills, which are all important for personal and professional development.  In conclusion, I believe that students with a C average or lower should be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school. By doing so, we can provide them with an opportunity to develop other skills and interests outside of the classroom, while also recognizing that not all students are able to maintain a higher grade. Additionally, allowing these students to participate in extracurricular activities can help them develop important social and leadership skills, which will benefit them in the future.
Attending school in person provides students with a variety of advantages that cannot be achieved in an online learning setting. For starters, attending school allows for the development of key social skills that are important in ones daily life, such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. In a physical school setting, students have the opportunity to learn these skills through direct interactions with their peers and teachers. Furthermore, the face-to-face classroom setting allows students to actively engage with the material in a meaningful way, creating a memorable environment where learning can take root.  In contrast, online classes are generally viewed as a solitary learning experience with no physical interaction between teacher and student. It follows that without direct participation in the classroom setting, it is more difficult for students to fully understand and retain the material. Additionally, students miss out on the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the material through in-person activities such as group projects, class presentations, and discussions â all of which can contribute to their overall success in school.  Overall, attending school in person provides students with a supportive and interactive learning environment that helps lay the groundwork for a strong academic career. For these reasons, traditional school settings tend to be more beneficial for students than online classes.
I think that animals should not be used in scientific research at all. It is wrong to use them for our benefit, especially when it harms them physically and mentally. We should respect animals and treat them with kindness.  One of the main reasons why I believe animals should not be used in scientific research is because it is cruel. For instance, animals are often forced to eat or inhale chemicals, which can make them sick or even kill them. Moreover, they are often kept in tiny cages for long periods of time, which can cause them to become depressed or anxious.  Animals also have rights, and we have a moral responsibility to protect them from harm. It is unfair to use them for our benefit without consent. They cannot speak up for themselves, so it is up to us to be their advocates.  Finally, there are alternative methods to animal testing that can be used. For example, computer modeling and in-vitro testing can provide accurate results without the use of animals. These methods are more humane and can also save money.  In conclusion, we should not use animals in scientific research because it is cruel and violates their rights. Instead, we should use alternative methods that are more ethical and respectful towards animals.
Cars are a part of everyday life. You use them to drive to school, to work, out to eat, or to the movies with all of your friends. But what if you didnt have cars? What if you werent allowed to use them? Many places around the world, like Europe, Colombia, Paris, and even some parts of the United States, have started to end the car culture. This has proven to be very beneficial in keeping the earth clean, safe, and and healthy.  Greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes in cars have been a big culprit in pollution. In paragraph 5 in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, it states cars are responsible for 12% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in widely used car areas in the United States. In Paris, they inforced a partial driving ban to clear their air after near-record breaking days of pollution. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, having had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, which compared to other paces like London, who only 79.9, thats a lot of smog. With limited driving, the pollution will decrease and benefit the environment over time.  Not only does the limited use of cars increase the overall health and safety of Earth, it helps keep us safe too. Multiple car accidents happen every single day around the world. As you would know, without cars, there would be no car accidents. Accidents such as theseÂ  can be caused by traffic. When driving on the highway with cars surrounding you, all going 70 mph, theres a high risk of getting into an accident.Â  During Frances partial ban of cars, the congestion, or car traffic, was down 60% than normal. This lessened the chance of accidents and made the roads more safe, for both drivers/pasangers, and those walking along the streets.  Since cars would no longer be in use, how would you get around? In Columbia, many citizens hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during their car free day. Without the use of cars, Americans and others would actually get up and move to get to where they need to go, which isnt something thats common anymore. America is the most obese country in the world, with most of the top obese cities residing in Texas. Cars give us another excuse to not be active in our everday lives. If everyone had limited use of cars, everyone as a whole may get the daily exercise they need to say at a healthy state.  Although cars are useful to get us to the places we need to go fast, they are not required or needed. They let off gases that are harmful to our environment, can be hazardous to ourselves and others, and should be replaced to play against obesity and unwellness. The cons of cars outweigh the pros and everyone should be turning off their cars and stepping outside.       Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â     
Driving while using a cellular device is very dangerous, but it can be useful at certain times. The use of cellphones ranges from informational, to recreational activities. The use of cellphones during driving can be catastrophic not many people have the skills to watch the road and their phone at the same time. The fact of the matter is that its too dangerous to let people use cell phones while they drive, the accidental crashes that happen each year would skyrocket. I advocate for a ban of drivers using cellphones while driving.  Approximately 660,000 drivers try and use cellphones behind the wheel of an automobile according to edgarsnyder. com. This is extremely risky as not being focused while driving can lead to death by car crash, not just for the driver at fault but everyone in the crash. The drivers of America need to be attentive when operating a vehicle because of: pedestrians, stop signs, public and or private property, cars, trucks, etc. The mortality rate of people in car crashes are very high, and the property damages done are very extreme, not to mention that it can cause problems later in life as well. Overall its not even worth the trouble to use your cellular device while driving.  To look at the perspective through another persons shoes is the key to understanding why this is true. The thought of leaving this world or being the cause of someone else leaving this world is enough for me not to even think about using a cellphone while driving. The hearts of the family members who had their loved ones taken away makes me tear up. A great man once told me, all life is precious and it is not up to man but our creator to take it away.  There is nothing more wrong than knowing that you took a human life and that is the reason I think cellular device use during driving, should be illegal.      
We should go with changing to election by popular vote for president because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century,the system allows for much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousisiana legislature nearly succeded inÂ  replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.  Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In the case, the election would be thrown to the house of Representatives, where state delegations vote for president. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode island and South Carolina, and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad.  Its official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. So the United states will not being the Electoral college       Â        Â     
School administrators have proposed extending the school day by two hours and having a four day school week. If implemented, this change could have several potential consequences for students, teachers, and schools.   First and foremost, most students would likely oppose this idea due to the extended time spent in school each day, along with the weekends no longer being a block of days to catch up on assignments and prepare for tests. The extra time might place more stress on students, negatively affecting their mental health. In addition, this might lead to more absences from school due to fatigue and poorer academic performance as a result of the extended day.   For teachers, this type of schedule could mean that more planning and preparation for classes would need to be done to make the two extra hours meaningful and worthwhile. This additional planning might pose a challenge for some teachers and could lead to burnout. Furthermore, the additional time for instruction might lead to more frequent lesson plans and the need for additional grading and feedback from the teachers.   In terms of schools, implementing a four-day week and extended day schedule could have some potential logistical issues. Schools would need to ensure that enough buses are available for the extended route times, along with the management of cafeteria routines, student drop-off and pick-up times, and the coordination of sports and extracurricular activities.   Overall, extending the school day to two more hours and having a four day school week could have significant consequences for students, teachers, and schools. Although there could be some advantages to this type of scheduling change, school administrators need to carefully consider all of the potential issues before moving forward.
Dear principle,  I highly urge you to take some things into consideration before making your final decision on the policy change. Many students participating in sports have a C grade average. If you change the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B grade average, many students will not have anything they participate in besides school. How healthy could that be? It isnt. I believe you should make a policy that allows anyone with a C grade average or higher allowed to participate in sports and other activities. If they have a D or F grade average, then I agree that they should spend more of their time working on school work so they dont fail, but why make the students be above average just to participate in something besides school? I have three important reasons for pressing the matter. Firstly, if the students are not near the risk of failing, they should have the chance to participate in sports and other activities. Secondly, sometimes being in a sport helps students to have better concentration and energy, which will cause them to be better in school. And lastly, if students have something to participate in they will be more willing to try harder in school.  Think about this. If someone has always gotten Cs and has been able to maintain an average grade, then they shouldnt have to try to be above average just to be able to play a favorite sport. This may cause students stress and anxiety. If you lower the policy to a C grade average, then the children just might do better in school overall.  Concentration has always been a big deal in school hasnt it? Participating in sports will help students have better concentration and energy for school work. It is proven that if a student has more participation in other activities, that they do twice as good as those that arent in other activities. Why cause them to have to have a good grade to do sports, when they could get better grades by doing sports?  One last thing to think about is if students have something to participate in, wouldnt they want to try harder in school to be able to stay in that sport or activity? Motivation is always a major helper in school work. Would that not be a good motivation?  Now that you understand my reasons for wanting to avoid the change in policy, please think a little harder about it. If Cs are average, why change that? Being a sport or other activity, may sometimes give the students more concentration and energy therefore, help them to do better in school. If students have something to participate in, wouldnt they want to try harder? Thank you for taking these major reasons into consideration.  Sincerely, a student.
I think students should commit to career at young age because of these reasons.  Students should commit to a career at a young age because it may have them in school because students may be thinking about there future and then get movtivated to get more done. Students at young age also be invasted in the career they may choose for example being a soccer player, being a basketball player, being a football player etc. This the first reason why students should commit to a career at a young age cause it will help them become a better person in life and also help there future.  Students should also commit to a career because it will help them perpare for life because they will be getting for college and thats a big step from highschool that is there road to succues because when they are in college they will be learing about there future job whiles if students who dont think about there future at a young age will probaly go down hill for them somethng like getting into drugs or getting killed this is a second reason why students should commit to a career at a young age.  Students should commit to a career so that can can have a good life because if you dont think of a career at a young age you will not be good in life there many example like being homeless. Therefore students should start thinking about a career because it would be coming so fast.  These the reasons why students should commit to a career at a young age for a better future.
Driverless cars are a relatively new concept in the automobile industry, and the benefits they offer could potentially decrease the risk in driving, especially given the inconsistencecy of drivers in todays world. While this is a tempting and seemingly perfect solution to reducing the number of car accidents, I do not support the idea of driverless cars.  The author states in section four that, The combination of all of this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. While humans are not in any way perfect drivers, the natural instincts and reactions of a human behind the wheel are impossible to capture in the form of sensors, robots, or mechanincs of any kind. In situations where unorthodox solutions are needed to remain in control of the car and keep from crashing, veteran drivers have the knowledge and experience to do so. Robots may have programs to react in certain situations, or to move out of the way if an object is coming towards the car at a rapid speed, but not all situations can be programmed. Robots simply cannot react the same ways humans do, which brings me to my next reason for not supporting driverless cars.  Section eight of the passage focuses on the psychological aspects of driverless cars, and introduces thd idea of laziness and boredom in human nature. Later on, the author states that some manufacturers hope to address this problem by including entertainment in the cars to remedy this boredom. Bringing in car entertainment wuld only further distract the now obsolete human drivers from the road, which in the case of an emergency, could prove fatal to not only the driver, but the passengers in the car as well. The Google car mentioned in section 7 Announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. If the human did not hear the car announce this, and the car was reverted to the drivers control, the driver might end up in a crash. If the driverless cars provide more distractions than are at hand in the world today, no matter if a human is driving or not, the human driving the car could end up dead along with the passengers of the car. If driverless cars do become a reality, human drivers may one day become obsolete.  Todays world is focused heavily on transportation and getting from one point to the next. Driverless cars would fufil this requirement, but without the help of human drivers. The more that driverless cars would develop and improve, the less and less amount of humans would know how to drive. While this does not seem like a major problem if driverless cars were a reality, but the malfunctioning of systems would prove to be chaotic. If there was a systemwide problem with driverless cars, all of the vehicles in use, malfuctioning or not, would have to be recalled and fixed, causing mass hysteria. Because of the loss of driving skills, nobody would know how to drive. Humans would be unable to travel places, go to work, or do recreational activities.  Driverless cars may promote many benefits to humans seeking leisure and comfort while driving, but driverless cars could prove to create some very serious safety issues, especially on the busy roads of todays society.
Rosa Parks became an icon of the civil rights movement for her determined stand against racial discrimination. A seamstress from Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks was arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. In response to her arrest, members of the African American community in Montgomery initiated a boycott of the cityâs bus system. This boycott helped catalyze national efforts to end racial segregation.  The motivating force behind Rosa Parkss actions was her strong work ethic and enduring commitment to justice. As Thomas Jefferson said, âI like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.â Rosa recognized the potential of a future where everyone was treated equally and she was determined to achieve that vision. âCharacter is like a tree and reputation is like its shadow,â Jefferson said. Rosas commitment to her beliefs ensured her place in history. Ultimately, Rosa Parkss courageous stand demonstrated the potential of a determined work ethic to bring about positive change.
I would go with policy 1, because there are many reasons why students would have their cell phones with them. There could have been something bad in your family and one of your parents might call to notify you what has happened, theres some kind of murderer in the school and the phones are out and cell phones are the only device to contact someone when you really need help, or you are on school grounds in a severe condition and there is no one else there to help you, you could either call for help or use your cell phone. I kind of support the use of cell phones even though I dont own one, I might ask for someone to use theirs when I need to make a call. Even though these events are rare, you might not know what will happen. In my opinion, I would tell the principle to use policy 1.  If I asked all the students who have cell phones with them if they want policy 1, there would be a chance that most of them would say yes. If I asked teachers with cell phones, probably most of them would want policy 2. I have already wrote a letter to the principle before this for an assignment if students should be allowed to have cell phones, either for educational use, emergency, or at certain time periods. Students want their cell phones with them just to be equal to their teacher, even though we are already equal by having an education and what events the school hosts for us to join.
Have you ever thought of being a cowboy then your in luck becase today you can be a seagoing cowboy and see not just cows but unique places in the world and see places in the world that you thought only existed in books and movies.  If you thought that you would be wrong the places in books are sometimes real and sometimes not and if you want to help people and go on a advencher this is the job for you. The perks of this job would be the trip and if a cow dies of old age it is a steak cook out and you can see more animals you thought possible in a bout. The sea is a inportant part of the job and if you are scard of water then this job is not for you.  Now the sites of a seagoing cowboy are absolutely amassing you could see greece and the Parthonon and rome with the romen coloseum and china with its large 16th cenchery builidings and spain with its large docks with large sea vesalls and englend and buckinghem palice and the tower of london and big ben and germeny the starting place of the war and home of hitller and berlin. If you like steak and other meat meals then you have to eat somthing different then your favoret meals becase of the cow on the ship the might get a little wored and start to get out of control but dount let a cow stop you from bring a seagoing cow boy and help with the things we need the do to help thoughts in need.  If you dount have patince then this job is not the job for you becase if you have optins that are always fast then go for that and dount get this job becase this job needs alote of patince.  So if you relly want to get this job then you are exepted.  Mead by Gabriel.
Phone While Driving  Using your cell phone while driving has become a bigger issue now due to the increased popularity of use in technology. People have begun to use cellphones more than the traditional GPS so they use it as an excuse to using your cell phone while driving. It is even harder to avoid using your cellphone while driving unless you put your phone on do not disturb while youre driving but even doing that there is very little that you can do to avoid people calling and distracting drivers from the road. Using your phone while driving also leads to many car accidents because people just arent paying attention to the road. Driving and using phones can cause death , is hindering childrens lives,and how we can prevent death in our society,  The death rate has gone up because 263 teens (ages 15 to 19) were killed as a result of distracted driving in 2016 at least half of teen deaths in motor vehicles among young people are related to using cell phones while driving .This is becoming a very serious matter and may be affecting someone close to you.  The national safety council of the united states of america said thatcell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Car accidents can lead to deaths and also brain cell lossage these things can and will affect the futures of people who are involved in them. A way to lower these numbers would be by closely monitoring your own and the people who are around you cell phone usage while driving and always speak up when you see people doing it.  cell phone use while driving has gotten out of hand because of the increased popularity of use in technology. It has become a bigger issue because people who do it believe driving and using their phone is ok and no one will catch them, and do not take it as a serious issue. That is why it has gotten out of control because people think of it as a law that can be broken and it is nowhere near that.  If Driving and using phones was to be taken more serious less crashes would happen.  Without people speaking up driving and using cellphones will only continue to happen if we dont apply these better ways to prevent it. cell phone use while driving is a very serious issue and should be taught to more of our youth so that accidents can be lowered and we can live in peace. because Driving and using phones is not ok, and drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.         
Hey, its me, an average 8th grade student!  So, I gotta write this essay about how setting a good example is the best way to influence other people, or if there are better ways to do it. I gotta say, I think setting an example is pretty important. Like, if youre always being kind and respectful to others, theyre more likely to do the same. Its like, if you want your little brother or sister to clean their room, you should show them how its done first. Theyre more likely to do it if they see you doing it too.  But, I also think that speeches and actions can be pretty influential too. Like, if someone gives a really powerful speech about why something is important, it can make people want to change their ways. And if someone does something really cool or brave, it can inspire others to do the same. For example, if a famous athlete starts a foundation to help kids in need, it can inspire other athletes to do the same.  And trustworthiness is also a big deal. If someone is trustworthy, people are more likely to listen to them and do what they say. Like, if your teacher is always fair and honest, youre more likely to listen to them and do your homework.  But, if theyre always yelling and being mean, youre not gonna wanna listen to them.  So, in conclusion, setting a good example is a pretty good way to influence others, but its not the only way. Speeches, actions, and trustworthiness can also be really influential. Its like, a combination of all of those things can make a bigger impact. And, its important to be consistent in what you do and say, so people can trust you and listen to you.  Oh, and one more thing. I think its important to remember that everyone has their own way of influencing others. Like, some people might be really good at giving speeches, while others might be better at setting an example. So, its important to find what works best for you and use it to make a positive impact.   Thats my essay! *ner
Today in society we have alot of disagreements on which president should be elected on the day all votes are finally counted and the votes are tallied up to the final result of who is going to be our new president of the United States, but what is our system for doing this?  One way is  Electoral College,  Electoral college is a process consisted of thye selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the votes from congress. So if you think about it we are just electors for electors. This College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes can win the election for the President.  Under the Electoral college, voters dont vote for the president, they vote for state electors who in turn elect the president. There are many veiw points of the Electoral College, but most would decied that its unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions whithout much basis in reality. People want to have their vocies hear for the country they live in, they want an opinion that matters! You cant have that when someone else is speaking for you...    
Zoos are like super important for conservation and education and stuff. They help us learn about animals and how to protect them. But some people think theyre bad and that we shouldnt have them. Im gonna argue for zoos because theyre pretty cool and help us save animals.  Firstly, zoos help us learn about animals that we wouldnt normally see in our daily lives. Like, Ive never seen a giraffe or a lion in person, but Ive seen them at the zoo. Its really cool to see them up close and learn about them. We can learn about their habitats, what they eat, and how they live. Its way better than just reading about them in a book.  Secondly, zoos help protect animals from going extinct. They have breeding programs to help increase the population of endangered species. For example, the Toronto Zoo has a program to help protect the giant panda. They have a special habitat for them and theyre trying to breed them to release back into the wild. Thats really cool!  Thirdly, zoos help us understand how to take care of animals. They have veterinarians who study the animals and figure out what they need to stay healthy. They can also teach us how to care for our pets and other animals we encounter in our lives.  But, some people think zoos are bad because they think its cruel to keep animals in captivity. They think its like prison for animals. But, zoos are actually really good for animals because they provide them with food, shelter, and protection from predators. And, theyre not just keeping them in small cages, they have big habitats that are like their natural environments.  In conclusion, zoos are really important for conservation and education. They help us learn about animals, protect them from going extinct, and teach us how to care for them. So, we should keep zoos open and support them because theyre doing a lot of good for animals and for us.  Please grade this essay and provide feedback. Thanks!
Limiting car usage nowadays is very well for the enviroment. Not using cars so much lowers polution, and is a great way for humans to start interacting with one-another again.  The Car-Free cities started in the suburbs of Germany. Almost everyone completely gave up their cars. P2 L1-2 states that stret parking and drivewats and home garages are generally forbidden. If you are not completely car-free you pay $40,000 to buy space to park you car(s) along with a home.  Statistics say that 70 percent of families d not own cars anymore, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move to Germany. Heidrun Wlter stated When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way.  In Paris, due to near-record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.  On certain days motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. the other days same rules apply to odd-numbered license plate owners.  The more cities that start doing a ban on driving cars or use more enviroment healthy cars are helping reduce pollution and other toxins in the air. p43 states that the Ford company is already making changes to their cars/trucks to make them more enviromentally safe.  The rate of Kids and aduts between the ages of 16-39 getting their licenes and permits have dropped drastically within the past few years. With communication the computers and telephones, teens and alduts feel connected by talking on these devices and dont feel the need as much to drive to go see a friend and find it easier to stay intouch.  In Bogota, Colombia millians of people hike, bike, skate or took buses to work durin a car-free day. It was the third year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Wihout Cars in the city. The turnout was large, despite the occasional rain they ecieved, that didnt stop the colombians for doing what they did.Â  Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution said Carlos Arturo Plaza. Two other Colobian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the Day Without Cars event. The citites are generation a revolutionary change in the world.  Parks and sports centers have bloomed throught the city, sidewalks have been repaired and rush-hour has been cut.  The United states has realized a drastic change in driving. Fewer people are getting their licenses. as of 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in 1995 (P32 L9-12).    
Dear Principal,  The first reason that would make this a terrible idea is the fact that a C average is the main grade in all schools around the country for eligibility. The other reasons are: how bad do you want the school to look when the sports teams do not have any of its good players. The other fact is that it would be unfair to the students for you to make some type of sudden change like that when being eligible for a C average was the old rule. Kids would freak out and people probably will not support your new school policy as I am now. This could really start a huge issue against your self and it might even back fire and not work at all, I do not recommend trying this.  I would not agree with your new policy, you should not carry this out it will hurt many students and you may even lose kids from the school that sports means their life to them. So, please take my thoughts into consideration so you do not make a bad decision that may get you not wanted back as principal for next year. Also, if you are going to make this decision at least add it in the student hand book before the year starts so you do not throw everyone off. You will ruin the kids entire year if you do this new school policy. Parents will be raving about it and students will talk about you badly and dislike you greatly.  The only good part about this policy is that it will drive students in their academics to make the extra grades to be able to play on the sports teams. The students will have to become more dedicated mentally than they have ever been before. Your school will get attention by all of the hard work that the students have displayed to pull up the average higher, this could lead to other schools following your policies as well to see how their students do. This is better for the students long term affect, so that they can have better work ethics and maybe keep using them throughout their lives.  Do whatever you think is necessary and should be carried out, but make sure you watch very closely to all of the students to see how they are reacting and if they are doing more well or worse. If your students are doing worse, then I would recommend you to talk to the teachers so that they can try to reach out to the kids more to help them make the grade that is necessary for eligibility. You have good ideas, but just be careful and do not make any mistakes you might regret. Read other students letters to get more opinions about the topic, do your research, and make your decision wisely. Im sure you will make the correct analysis as to what should be done and what should not be messed with. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope it makes a change and fills your mind with the ideas of a fellow student.      
World is change every second. Each year grow tree. But people cut trees faster.  Some people says to be succesful in our life person need be yourself. But, why?  Be yourself is the best way to be succesful.  But most of people dont know, how be succesful? They think that to have money they will be succesful. For example, peoples try be IT programers, because someone say that they earn more money. But most people dont know, what it is and in this area most people are new. Their dont want work and their work are looks not good. After a couple time, they left this job and they trying somthing else. Only couple of them stay on this area. Another example is students. This year some students will be grated, and they dont come back to school again. Nobody dont ask Does student want go to school?. And this is one of the reason, why students dont want go to school. But, those years that he was in school, he will be remind.  Most people dont know, what will be after four years. Students go to college which say their parents.  Most of us to survive in this life doing that he or she dont want. Most imigrants come to rich countries because they have money. They learn their native language just to have more money.  One person say Make your job what you want to do and you wouldnt work, never. We dont think how we can be succesful? And its make wrong desision. People think that be painter or artist is bad, because they dont have much more money. This mind is wrong. Artists are be not bad because they live by yourself.  To find yourself is hard because it take time and other people influens to other people. But when person find yourself his or her life will be happy.  Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, To be yourself in world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment  I agree, because yourself its make life better.
Limiting car usage comes with benefits for everything. It benefits the environent, yourself, and everyone else in the world.  If you use your car less or just use it when you need it, the amount of pollutants in the air from vehicle transportation would drop drastically. Vehicles are the second leading cause of pollution in the world behind factories. Cars are responsible for up to fifty percent of gas emissions in heavy traffic areas in the United States according to Elisabeth Rosenthals essay In German suburb, life goes on without cars. It is a very simple concept, cars produce gas emission, and using your car less can help protect the environment from pollutants.  The environment is not the only thing benefitted from limited car usage. You become healthier if you choose to totally lose the vehicle. Heidrun Walter statedÂ  When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way. Limiting car usage can also limit stress in a person. Besides being stress free, if you choose to walk to where you need to go, you exercise and do not realize it. Basically, if you want to lower your stress, not be tense, or be healthier, just limit your car usage and walk or ride a bicycle.  Vehicle accidents are a major cause of death in the world. So, if you decide to not use your car as much and just walk or bike, that is one less driver on the road. If the trend of limiting car usage and walking or biking spreads, the threats on the roadways will lower drastically. So in turn, using your car less can help keep everyone safe and help lower the amount of vehicle accidents and save lives.  With more people on the side walks, and less people behind the wheel, everyone can be benefitted. From stress to gas emission, everything can be solved with limiting your car usage.

In this passage, the author uses evidence to support the idea that human curiosity should overpower and enable us to explore the unknown and seemingly impossible regardless of the risks or repercussions. Venus, Earths closest neighbor to the sun, poses one of these risks that could be overcome by desires of humanity. Despite its realtion in size and distance to Earth, Venus is much different and inhabitable for humans due to its thick atmosphpere corrosive atmosphere. Though it seems that true exploration of our sister planet could never be completed, isnt it worth the risk to discover as much as we can for the saie of humanity and its curiosity? The author of this passage seems to think so and does a great job of explaining why further exploration of Venus needs to occur regardless of the obstacles.  First, the author notes a specific way in which humans can encounter Venus landscape and conditions that is both safe and productive. In this way, a form of spacecraft would not come in direct contact with Venus surface, but it would hover above its atmosphere and be able to collect data on the dily occurences on Venus. This circumstance would allow humans to study Venus for themselves instead of a ship that would send data back to a base on Earth. The author also notes that researchers are developing ways to allows spacecraft to survive the conditions on Venus for a long enough period to collect data from its surface. Based on the type of technology that we have today, systems like these can be improved to resist the extreme conditions of Venus itself. If scientists are able to make products on Earth that could last through simulated versions of Venus here, then there should be no debate whether its worth a shot or not.  Overall, the author makes great use of the evidence they have to support the idea that Venus is worth exploring despite its obstacles. They also do a great job of looking into the developments and possiblities of the future that can further enable scientists and researchers to fulfill the desires to learn more about Venus. They wrap up their essay by saying that the exploration of the unknown should not be pushed aside because of the obstacles presented within it, which is a great overview of the side in favor of adventuring through Venus altogether.    
The debate over implementing a four-day work week in schools is an ongoing discussion in the education system. While many view the change with optimism, there are also several disadvantages associated with reduced school hours. This essay will aim to analyze opinions from all stakeholders in the school district, considering the effects of such a policy both socially and financially.   The most obvious benefit of a four-day work week in schools is the potential of increased productivity. Students would be able to spend more time with their families and pursue leisure activities that are not available during regular school hours, leading to improved physical and mental health. Advocates of the policy also mention that a day off can serve as a reward for students who perform well in classes.   However, several considerations need to be made before implementing such a policy. Parents and other staff members may have difficulties providing additional childcare or transportation services on the extra day. Teachers would also have to find more creative ways to fit a full weeks worth of material into four days. Furthermore, there could be significant financial consequences to such a decision, including increased energy consumption and reduced wages for hourly-based employees.   It is important to understand that the decision to implement a four-day work week in schools is a complicated one. All stakeholders in the school district need to voice their opinions and come together to find a compromise that works for everyone involved.
The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers it presents because ...may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.  If thats the case, we should most definitely try to explore Venus. It would be hard but possible because NASA has compelling ideas for sending humans to study Venus. Their idea was to allow scientists to float above the fray. Meaning they would be about 30 miles or so in the air avoiding Venuss harsh ground conditions. Since their about 30 miles above the surface, the temperatures would be a cozy 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the air pressure would close to that of sea levels on Earth and radiation would not exceed Earths levels. This isnt easy conditions for humans but its survivable.  However, hovering over Venus from a ship above the planet is safe but it cant get us certain information that well need like samples of gas, rocks, or anything else. But the good news is, NASA is working on other alternatives to study Venus. An example of this would be, ...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks..., Another example would be, mechanical computers. Mechanical computers are devices that make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics what so ever. Though modern computers are powerful, they tend to be weak when it comes to extreme physical conditions. By comparison,systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.  In conclusion, We will eventually get to Venus and when we do, we will not only gain insight on the planet, but we will also get to see what human curiosity can lead us to. Our travels in space should not be limited by doubts and dangers because without doubt and danger how will we expand our horizons and learn? 
I Luke Bomberger am a veteran seacowboy. The segoing cowboy program isnt all hard work. You should join the program because it is a chance of a lifetime, you visit cool places, and you get to have fun. The cowboy program is meant for you.  This a one time offer. You dont know how long this opperation will be running. When my friend asked me to do I thought, I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime. I decided I am going to go. You should go too.  Another reason you should go is that you travel all over the world. You get to see things that you would never imagen. The places were unbelieveble. When I was a cowboy, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.Â Another event I remeber was in Venice were we road a gondola on the streets of water.  I always liked the end of the trips because after all the hard work we had fun. We had had so many games. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. with all these games we never wanted to leave the sea. If you came too, you could do play too. We spent so much time having fun I knew it was the best decision I made.  After all those years I stopped, but I still remember the adventure. Most of all I remember it was a chance of a lifetime, all the trips we made, and all the fun we had. The trip was definintly worth it.
I think the new Facial Action Coding could be true, because nowadays we have more technology. The 3-D computer model of the face could actually see our face expressions. Maybe it wont actually know what we feel inside like our mood. The Facial Action Coding update can just tell us if we have a annoyed,sad,mad etc face. Sometimes, people seem sad or mad but thats just their thinking or worried face.  If the technology of the Facial Action Coding System was that powerful ir smart to read students emotions, it would be good and cool. Teachers would actually know why there student is quiet or why theyre not doing anything in class. My evidence is that  by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotions). if youre really close with a friend or family member youll know if their upset or not.  You see them everyday you already know how they are. The Facial Action Coding System would just study your face and tell you how you are. Whoever came up with that software and the emotional expressions came out wrong. Then, people wouldnt trust it anymore. When you smile and your cheek bones raise then that a real smile and a showing all your teeth.  Sometimes, when someone is really upset or dont want to be rude they can fake a smile that looks so realist. The software update also could follow is the student is bored or not knowing what to do. We honestly need that in all school. Some kids are always disrespectful or always getting in trouble, never doing work. The Facial Action Coding System would be so much help for everyone. The software update knew about the painting Monsa Lisa face expressions. 
arguing wheater use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuble? Yes because the article say.  For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Using this tecnology is valuable because anatomy to allowed them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. to how its going to work on the compter. Its valuable because it can tell how Mona Lisa demontrates is really intended to bring a smile.  The muscled called?  Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows-feet around your eyes. That means how the face muscles. It work and whats it called to get ride of these things. Before hand, it make the false smile, the mouth streched sideways using the zygosmtic major and a diffrent muscle .  Having a seemd of expression?  according to the reading in paragraph 7 while looking in the mirror rise your lips at. The corners of your mouth is decribing you reaction to your face. Then squint your eyes slightly to produced wrinkling, Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks of your cheeck up, torward you eyes.  Conclusion states that people have beautful everything around them! Not to mention, while looking in the mirrow process can make you a good pro at expressing your emtions. secdonly, muscles its an expert, faces dont lie. These muscles clues are somtimes used to spot when smiling. Politiian or celebritu isnt being truthful.
I think that the electoral votes should not decide who the president is. This is a nation where people have the right to vote, and the fact that the votes of the people dont even matter is not right. What is the point in even voting if our vote doesnt count, what is the point in the candidate giving speeches to the people if its all just for nothing. The popular votes are the ones that should be counted twards who becomes the president. People all over the country are told to vote, or are guilted into voting becomes its a right that we should be happy and proud to have but then the vote that we put on the ballot doesnt make a difference, its the electoral votes that really matter. What makes them more important than us. The electoral votes are not democratic.  Yes the electoral college does somewhat ballence out the big states from the little states (based on population) but that still doesnt matter. If over 50% of the United States votes for one person but then they lose to someone with a little more electoral college votes then are they really our president, we the people didnt vote for him so then why is he allowed to be our president. The founding fathers gave us the right to vote but the truth is that the vote isnt really real. I think we should just change it so that the people are the ones that get their votes counted because you cant tell us to go voted and then not even let it mean something. Being able to vote is one of the things that we have that most other countries dont have, but the reality is that our vote is disregarded and somebody else makes the vote for us.  Do you think that people are going to want to vote for someone if it is basically just a waste of time. If the votes actually counted I bet a lot more people would go to the polls. People would be more interested in the speeches and wanting to listen to their views if they knew that their vote was important to the candidate. In 2012 only about a half of the people who were eligible to vote didnt and that number could keep getting lower if we dont change it. The younger generation doesnt care right now because they already know that their vote doesnt matter.  The electoral votes only have five reasons as to why they should stay.  Certain of outcome  -Incase of dispute over the outcome  Everyones president  -Requires candidate to have trans-regional appeal  Swing states  -Winner-take-all method awarding electoral votes  Big states  -Balances the small states and the big states (population)  Avoid run-off elections  -Avoids both candidates havingno majority  The electoral votes dont seem to be very American. The whole electoral college system is confusing and as said in the passage Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. If we were to have a vote (and the peoples votes actually counted) that asked people if they want to keep the electoral college or get rid of it I bet over 50% of the people in this country would want to get rid of it.    
Cell phones and Driving  ___  It was a exceptionally exciting day for 17-year-old  Brenda because she had not seen her best friend Madison for the past two weeks. Brenda got into her car, put on her seatbelt, and texted Madison to let her know she was picking her up. While driving,  Brenda opened a text five minutes later from Madison.  Taking her eyes off the curvy road for a mere five seconds, she was struck head on by a speeding sports car.  Brenda was gone just like that. Texting while driving . . . is the act of composing, sending, reading text messages, email or making simular use of the web on a mobile phone while operating a motor vehicle1. In fact, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles, 63% of drivers report using their cell phone while driving. Numerous reasons exist for the case against cell phone usage while driving such as texting, making phone calls, and checking social media apps.  First , One out of four car accidents in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Texting is a distraction while driving your eyes need to be on the road to avoid accidents.  Therefore When your texting your eyes are on your phone distracted by anything else around you. So many people think they are a professionals at texting And driving but it shouldnt be a skill theres to much at risk. Number one being deaths there are at least deaths a day due to texting and driving.  Second , Driving and talking on the phone can be just as dangerous as texting and driving. A new study shows accident are more likely when youre using a hands free phone device then when youre talking to a passenger youre also very likely to speed. Also a big misconception is that as long as you hands are free you should be safe no problem right?... Wrong. Having a voice engage people in conversation that make some people react badly or late to hazards so that is a distraction similar to texting and driving.  Lastly , According to a study Checking social media is just as dangerous as drunk driving. Unfortunately Teens have been so affected by society they always have their phones out snapchatting or posting something about the morning traffic. Personally this is the worst one the list. Checking is examining something in order to determine its accuracy , quality , or condition meaning you would be doing this for a good amount of time. Enough time to be in an accident. For example taking your eyes off the road for 5 seconds going 50 miles an hour is like driving blindfolded for a length of a football field which is extremely dangerous.  In conclusion here in the state of georgia there is a no hands law were holding or supporting , with any part of the body , wireless telecommunications device or stand alone electronic device (for example , an ipod). This law is going to prevent many accidents of course people will still do it i known people who do but the statics will go down.  1 Texting while driving - Wikipedia. https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Texting_while_driving.

Driverless cars have been imagined for many years. Theyve come close to building it but fails to be officaly called driverless cars, google has tryed but have only made it to where the car alerts a driver if to close to an object. Theirs been other ways on trying to make a driveless car but come out in fails or to expasive, like the smart-road that has been tested and has had positve records but that would mean we would have to change all the roads and make knew ones that would take for ever and the money we would spend on that would leave our economy more in dete then we are. As the article said.  If driverless cars were to be created in the future how would that impact lifes and country? Well let me tell you more safte laws would have to be made like how would be acounted for if some one gets hurt because of a failer in the system, would it be the owner of the car or the companys fault for the failer in their technology. As the articl said that could cause major problams. With what I just mentioned that brings me to my second question. What if something in the car fails would that impact the intier car and cuase it to break down? As the artical mentions the people trying to creat the driveless car have been testing int with a lot of different technology as said in the artical theyve been using sensors, cameras and GPS on the cars, but what if one of the cameras or the sensors would fail to do their job while its driving on a highway or a main road that would cuase a worse accident then with someone driving it.  In conclusion I would prefer driving so I have more liabilty to know where im going and know that im the one driving. So i ask you would you rather lay your life and family or friends on a a computer or know that you can drive. That is my opion on driveless cars.
Hi im Luke and I joined the Seagong Cowboy program before. Its really fun we get to go on trips and really have fun. You can go on how many trips you can, but  I went on 9 trips in the Seagong Cowboy pogram. Baseally all you do is help people and go on trips. You help people by helping with there animals,unloaded the animals.  They also have some fun time too. I found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We cowboys played baseball and vollyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time. Like i said its really fun.  The Seagong Cowboy program it open up the world to me, Im really grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs,and that awreness stayed with me leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years. It can do the same to you if you just try.
There are numerous factors that can influence an individuals level of accomplishment at work. These can range from personal aptitudes such as aptitude and attitude, to external forces like the job market and workplace dynamics. Different individuals will have different levels of success depending on their individual skills and circumstances. It is important to consider that external factors such as the job market can often be out of the individuals control, yet still have an impact on their success. Different perspectives can also be taken; while overall outcomes may be influenced by factors beyond an individuals control, there are also those factors which are under an individuals control and within their power to impact. My conclusion is that it takes an effective combination of factors in and out of the individuals control to reach a high level of success. One must actively strive to embrace and optimise the elements that are in their control, while also taking into account external factors and their wider context.
Dear principal, you are considering of changing school policy so that we the students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have at least a grade B average. while many of us have a grade C, i know you are trying to make us bring our grades up by doing this but understand that we like doing sports and activities especially our favorites but you cant do that because it sounds like threat to us. you can do something else but not stopping us from sports and activities without making at least a B, please cancel this policy because we really need sports and activities to keep our body focus and healthy and we also promise to keep the good grades and do our homeworks, and try our best to keep up the A s and B s.  P. s please dont forget we love sports and activities because we the students really have fun with it.  Thank you.  From Your  Students
I think that the principal should allow students to use cell phones at school during all lunch, including times such as locker time, changing classes, and before school. This would be helpful because if a student left there school work for there next class at home, instead of asking there teacher to go to the office and call home, they can call home from there cell phone and save most of the hassle of going to the office. The phone could also serve as a mobile dictionary by using the internet on your phone you can find definitions on words that you dont know the meaning of.  During lunch phones can serve as ways to past the time when your finished eating, be used as communication instead of yelling across the lunch room, and used as communication out side as well. For example, when you cant find somebody outside or inside, you can simply send them a text asking them where they are and the can reply within moments.  Another reason to allow having cell phones at school is if a sports practice has been canceled, you can call your parents and tell them that practice has been canceled and they need to get to school earlier. Or, if your bus is late, you can call them to pick you up when possible.      
 I believe that having a positive attitude is essential in life. In my experience, maintaining a positive outlook has helped me achieve many of my goals and enjoy the good things that come my way. I have learned to always look on the bright side, even in difficult situations, and to be grateful for what I have. This has helped me to attract positive energy and opportunities into my life.  One of the benefits of having a positive attitude is that it allows you to give advice and support to others. When you approach people with a positive attitude, they are more likely to respond in kind. This can lead to a cycle of positivity and support, where both parties feel uplifted and motivated.  Its also important to remember that life is unpredictable, and that sometimes things may not go as planned. However, instead of dwelling on the negatives, its important to focus on the present moment and make the most of the situation. This can help you to find new opportunities and learn from your mistakes.  Overall, I believe that having a positive attitude is key to living a fulfilling and successful life. By focusing on the positive, you can attract good things into your life and make a difference in the lives of those around you.
 The advancement of technology has drastically altered the way people interact with one another. With the convenience of online shopping, entertainment, and communication, people can complete many tasks without ever leaving their homes. While this may seem like a positive development, I believe that the lack of human contact due to technology has negative effects on individuals lives.  Firstly, being isolated from others can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. People often miss out on the opportunity to meet new people, reconnect with old friends, and form meaningful relationships. This can lead to a decrease in self-esteem and a sense of disconnection from the world around them. In fact, studies have shown that individuals who spend too much time on technology are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues.  Secondly, the constant use of technology can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. People are more likely to spend their time sitting in front of screens rather than engaging in physical activity. This can lead to a host of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Furthermore, the lack of physical activity can also lead to a decrease in social skills and a lack of empathy for others.  Lastly, technology can have a negative impact on our environment. The production and disposal of electronic devices can contribute to pollution and resource depletion. Additionally, the constant use of technology can lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication, which can lead to a breakdown in communication and collaboration.  In conclusion, while technology has its benefits, it is important to recognize the negative effects it can have on individuals lives. It is crucial that we find a balance between using technology and engaging in meaningful human interaction. We should strive to spend more time outside, connecting with others and enjoying the world around us. Only then can we truly appreciate the benefits of technology and its role in our lives.
As an 8th grader, I find Ralph Waldo Emersons statement To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment to be incredibly inspiring and thought-provoking. In todays society, where conformity and following the crowd are often encouraged, Emersons words serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of exploring new areas and challenging oneself to grow both personally and professionally.  One of the most significant ways in which Emersons statement applies to various professions is through the concept of innovation. In order to stay ahead of the curve and make groundbreaking discoveries, professionals must be willing to venture into uncharted territory and challenge the status quo. For instance, scientists and researchers must be willing to take risks and explore new ideas in order to make new breakthroughs. Similarly, entrepreneurs must be willing to think outside the box and try new approaches in order to create innovative products and services.  However, it is important to note that professional sports players are an exception to the rule when it comes to Emersons statement. While they must also be willing to challenge themselves and push their limits in order to excel in their field, they are often subject to intense scrutiny and pressure to conform to certain expectations. For example, professional athletes may be expected to adhere to strict training regimens and diets in order to maintain their physical fitness and performance, which can limit their ability to explore new areas and pursue other passions.  In contrast, other cases where people are challenged to leave their comfort zone for growth include pursuing a new hobby or interest, such as learning a new language or instrument. By stepping outside of their comfort zone, individuals can discover new talents and abilities, and develop a greater sense of self-awareness and confidence. Additionally, traveling to new places and experiencing different cultures can also help individuals to grow and develop by exposing them to new ideas and perspectives.  In conclusion, Emersons statement highlights the importance of exploring new areas and challenging oneself in order to achieve personal and professional growth. While professional sports players may be an exception to the rule, the statement applies to various professions and aspects of life
 First impressions are often said to be difficult to change, but in my experience, they are not impossible. People make initial judgments about others based on their appearance, behavior, and demeanor, and while some of these impressions may be hard to shake, others can be changed.  First impressions are a natural part of human behavior, and everyone has made one at some point in their life. Whether its based on someones clothing, body language, or the way they speak, first impressions can greatly influence how we view a person. While some of these initial judgments may be accurate, others can be off-base and lead to misunderstandings.  In my experience, some of my first impressions have been difficult to change, while others have been completely altered over time. For example, I once had a negative first impression of someone based on the way they dressed and their body language, but as I got to know them better, I realized that my initial judgments were not accurate and that they were actually a kind and caring person.  On the other hand, other first impressions have been impossible to change. I have met people who I initially found attractive, but as I got to know them better, I realized that their personalities and behaviors were not compatible with my own, and I was unable to change my initial impression of them.  In conclusion, while first impressions can be difficult to change, they are not impossible. People can and do form initial judgments about others based on their appearance and behavior, but these impressions can be altered or completely changed over time as we get to know someone better. Its important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate and that its possible to form a more positive or negative impression of someone as we spend more time with them.
Generic_Name had always been passionate about exploring different career options, so they decided to take the time to do some research and really think about which one would be best suited for them. They read up about the potential areas and benefits of various careers, brainstormed their own ideas, and discussed the possibilities with their parents, teachers, and counselors. They also looked into opportunities outside of school that could help them along their chosen career path. After a lot of thought and careful consideration, Generic_Name finally decided on the career that they felt would perfectly align with their goals and dreams.
Goals are a vital key to most individuals life, whether they are a teenager, child, adult, or student. Ones goal may be to ace a test, anothers may be to pay off past student loans. Specifically, a teenagers goal may be to take the formal test to apply for a learners permit and eventually test for a drivers liscense. Driving is a symbolic step in a teenagers life signaling freedom and independence from their parents, however, with the ever-so-quickly evolving technological and engineering professions, this key factor is a teenagers life could be bypassed, similar to how an exit may be bypassed on an expressway. In the article Driverless Cars Are Coming driverless cars may be an option of the future. Driverless cars can be a beneficial investment.  Autonymous and semi-autonymous cars are evolving, rapidly, into safer vehicles than human-operated vehicles; tests have shown this since the 1980s when automakers used speed sensors at the wheels of vehicles in creation of antilock brakes. Now, if a person is in danger of skidding out of control or rolling over, the cars brakes can prevent this. Its also extremly prevalent here, in Indiana. A cars antilock brakes may assist an individual to stop at a slippery intersection on ice once the car notices that it is not decelerating at the rate expected by its computer. Another reason why driverless cars are a beneficial invenstment is BMWs development and release of the Traffic Jam Assistant. We all know that traffic jams in bigger cities such as: Chicago, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and even on freeways like Interstate-94 can be frustrating. However, with this stylish invention ones semi-autonymous car may handle the driving functions, that of a human, at up to speeds up to 25 mph. If one does not have to worry about focusing on the constant start-stop of the traffic, their trip may become substantially more enjoyable. Moving forward, driverless cars can be a beneficial investment because teenagers may like driving a semi-autonymous car versus a normal car better. Dr. Werner, a BMW project manager driver stresses, We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way One way that this could be done is by bringing in-car entertainment and informaton systems that use heads-up display. These displays can be turned off when the driver is needed to take over. This also doubles up as a safelty feature, which is a huge proponent in passing laws permiting these types of cars.  In conclusion, driverless cars are a very promising option of the future, with which I support. They are proven to be more succcessful and could benefit modern america, as well as, the rest of the world by helping Indians in India with the subpar driving conditions with which they endure. They can also help Americans with heavy traffic jams in megatropolis such as New York and Chicago. I believe that Driverless cars can be a beneficial investment and you should too.
Have you seen the Face on Mars? It was twenty five years ago when NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and snapped a photo of a landform that looked much like a human face. We, NASA, have noticed many people made conspiracy theories about the Face being made by aliens. We assure you this is not true. NASA wishes that there was an acient civilization on Mars that constructed the Face. The Face is a natural landform.  The Face is not an alien monument. Eighteen long years after the first mission and the first photograph was taken, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997. Chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin explained that we felt this was important to taxpayers, so we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. On April 5, 1998, MGS finally flew over the Face and snapped a photo ten times shaper than the orginal. This photo revealed a natural landform. If aliens did create the Face, there would be other clearer signs of alien work. For example, there would be huts, small shack figures or even Egyptain-style pyramids. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all, but not everyone was satisfied, so in 2001, NASA got another photo of it, much clearer and closer this time. It was still just a natural landform.  NASA went through a lot to get the three photos of the Face. The first one in 1976, the second in 1998, and the third in 2001. These three photos have shown everyone very clearly that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. Some even say it reminds then of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is, in fact, a natural landform. 
Lukes point of veiw of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that being a Seagoing Cowboy is awsome/cool and its an opportunity of a lifetime. It made him think about all the people in other countries that are fortunite and unfortunite and their needs. Plus when he was 18 he could of been drafted for the military service but when him draft boat learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. And by the time i was discharged in 1947, I made nine trips-most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Besides the cattle-boat trips were unbelievable, cause i got to help people like; I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. But what kept me busy was caring for the animals during the crossings. They had to be fedand watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out at my aunt Katies farm had prepared me for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On my second trip I served as night watchmen. My job was to check on all the animalsevery hour. But one night after my hourly checkup I slipped on a ladder and almost fell into the dark Atlantic, luckily a small strip of metal along the edge stopped me from falling. But I couldnt work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. When us Segoing Cowbays got boared when we had to return the animals I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,and games also helped pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more then just a adventuere, it opened up the world to me. And Im grateful for this opportunity. And that awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a umber of international students and exchange visitors for many year. And thats my point of veiw of me being Luke and being a Seagoing Cowboy.
Career pathways are an important aspect of a students life. It is essential for students to understand the different options available to them and to choose the one that best suits their interests and skills. In addition to choosing a career path, it is also important for students to gain practical experience in their chosen field. This can be achieved through partnerships with local companies.  One way to help students become aware of their interests is through career counseling. Career counselors can provide students with information about different career paths, as well as help them assess their skills and interests. This can be done through assessments, interviews, and other tools. By understanding their interests, students can make more informed decisions about their career path.  Partnerships with local companies can provide students with valuable opportunities to gain experience in their chosen field. These partnerships can take many forms, including internships, apprenticeships, and mentorship programs. Through these programs, students can gain hands-on experience in their chosen field, learn about the work that companies do, and network with professionals in their industry.  In addition to providing practical experience, partnerships with local companies can also benefit students in other ways. For example, these partnerships can provide students with valuable networking opportunities, which can be helpful when they graduate and enter the workforce. They can also provide students with the opportunity to learn about the skills and qualifications that are required for different careers.  Overall, partnerships with local companies can be a valuable tool for helping students understand their interests and gain practical experience in their chosen field. By working with local businesses, students can gain a better understanding of the different career paths available to them and make more informed decisions about their future.
Art, music, and drama classes are essential components of a well-rounded education. They provide students with an opportunity to express themselves creatively, develop their skills, and contribute to the culture of their nation. In this essay, I will argue that making these classes mandatory in schools is crucial for the development of the next generation of artists, musicians, and actors.  Firstly, competition is an essential aspect of any artistic endeavor. It is through competition that artists, musicians, and actors are able to push themselves to their limits and achieve greatness. Research has shown that competition can have a positive impact on students. A study conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts found that students who participated in arts and cultural programs were more likely to excel academically and have higher levels of self-esteem (Ruppert, 2016). By making art, music, and drama classes mandatory in schools, we can provide students with the opportunity to compete and develop their skills in these areas.  Secondly, music is an essential part of a nations culture. It is through music that we are able to connect with our past and understand our identity. For example, the music of Ireland, known as Irish traditional music, is an essential part of Irish culture. It is a unique blend of instruments, such as the fiddle, tin whistle, and uilleann pipes, and it is characterized by its lively, upbeat tempo. This music has been passed down from generation to generation and is an important part of Irish heritage. By making music classes mandatory in schools, we can ensure that students are exposed to the music of their nation and are able to appreciate its cultural significance.  Finally, many successful artists, musicians, and actors have started out in school. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, attended art school before becoming a writer. Similarly, BeyoncÃ©, the world-renowned singer and actress, began her career in school. By providing students with the opportunity to develop their skills in art, music, and drama, we can help to cultivate the next generation of successful artists, musicians, and actors.  In conclusion, making art, music, and drama classes mandatory in schools is crucial for the development of the next generation of artists, musicians, and actors. Competition is an essential aspect of any artistic endeavor, and
---  I believe that students should not have the right to grade their teachers. While it may seem like a good idea to give students a say in how their education is run, allowing them to grade their teachers would create a number of issues that would ultimately harm the education system.  Firstly, students may not always have the perspective necessary to judge their teachers effectively. While they are certainly in the best position to judge whether or not they are engaged in class, they may not always be able to determine whether their teacher is providing them with the best possible education. This is because students are often focused on their immediate needs, such as passing tests or getting good grades, rather than long-term outcomes like critical thinking and problem-solving skills.  Furthermore, allowing students to grade their teachers could lead to a number of negative consequences. For example, it could incentivize teachers to prioritize pleasing students over actually providing them with a quality education. This could be particularly problematic in cases where students are not able to accurately assess the quality of their education - if teachers are incentivized to make their students happy rather than educate them effectively, then the entire education system could suffer as a result.  Finally, I would like to note that there are already mechanisms in place to evaluate teacher performance - these include peer evaluations, standardized tests, and other forms of assessment that are designed to provide objective data about a teachers efficacy. While these mechanisms may not be perfect, they are certainly better than relying on student evaluations, which are subject to a variety of biases and other issues.  Overall, I believe that allowing students to grade their teachers would be a bad idea. Rather than relying on student evaluations, we should focus on improving existing evaluation systems to ensure that teachers are held accountable for providing their students with the best possible education. This may require some trial and error, but I believe that it is ultimately the best approach for ensuring that our education system remains strong and healthy for years to come.
Sports, yearbook, and clubs are all after school activities. They all help you get involved in your community and school. Being a part of an after school activities is awesome because you can meet new friend and have fun. Some people dont like getting involved in after school activities, but what if you had to be involved in at least one because the principal makes you; So would you agree of disagree with this rule. I would agree with this rule because getting students involved in an after school activity is a good thing it can teach them leader ship and they can also make new friends. they are also be active by being a part of an after school activity keeps them off the couch.  When part of an after school activity students can developÂ leadership and new skills. by being part of a school sports team students can learn leadership and they can stay active. if you are the best player on you chess club team then you can help the other people in the club and help them get better.  When you are a leader on the football field like a quarter back you need to be paying attention at all times. The can also help in the classroom because you could also learn how to pay attention in class more. no mater the activity you are apart of you can allows learn something new and learn how to be a leader.  Being part of an after school activity can help you become more active and even loose a couple of pounds. if you are on a school sports team you can stay active. Even if you are only going to a ports team conditioning most of the time every school sports team does something to stay active and stay in shape, and even after the season is over you can still stay active and exercise on you own so you can be ready for next season. being on a school team you can do and learn soÂ much from your coaches and you can even learn a few things on your own.  When you are part of an after school activity you can meet new people. If you cant make any friends at school then you could join in an after school activity and make a hole lot of friends. If you never try and make friends you will just be only all the time and have no one to hang out with and goof around with, But if you do get involved in an after school activity you can make friend s and maybe even if lasting friendships with people that went to the same school as you you would just never talk to anyone. So being a part of a school activity could change your life.  So that is the reason why I agree with making everyone be a part of at least on e after school activity they can accomplish so much. I just think that not being part of anÂ after school activity what would you do. Joining an after school activity wontÂ heart anything it will only help you it will help you learn leadership and new skills. It can also help you find new friends that you might end up hanging out with all the time.Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
There is a lot of things that cause pollution, but there is one pollution that is imparticular that pertains to these stories and thats air pollution. Air pollution is caused by fossil fuels. So people around the world are cutting car usage to prevent anything bad from happening. The advantages of limiting car usage are less air pollution, more exercies, and little burning of fossil fuels.  In the article In german suburb, life goes on without cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it says that in Vauban, Germany the residents have given up their cars. In Vauban they are forbidden to use cars. They made everything close together so tha the residents can be at walking distance. When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter. Heidrun is able to walk to any store because it is so close.  In the next article it talks about Paris baning driving. Paris ban driving due to smog. They were using diesel oil since Frane has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up mor than half of Frances vehicles. Paris has more smog than other European capitals. In Paris they had to make people with an odd or even numbered plate stop driving. They let the people with the odd numbered plates drive after the smog cleared up.  In the next article Colombia has their own car-free day. All the people in Colombia are doing outdoor activities that dont involve cars. This is their third straight year that cars are ban. There was slight rain, but that did not stop people from particpating, said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. For the first time Cali and Valledupar, two Colombian cities joined the event.  In conclusion, These articles generally talk about how some countries are trying to stop people from polluting the air. The advantages of limiting car usage are less air pollution, more exercies, and little burning of fossil fuels.       Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     
The Reality of Distance Learning  Have you ever taken the time to consider how much technology dominates our daily lives. The worldwide increase in technological advancements have changed peoples lives drastically in the past few decades. Like almost all other aspects of society, the education system was also majorly affected by this spur of innovations across the globe. Online resources such as e-textbooks and file sharing has made it possible to replace almost all physical assignments in our school system. While some technological advances do make education much easier and efficient, this doesnt mean doing everything regarding schoolwork online is a good idea. Schools are starting to offer distance learning as an option for students to work from home through online conferences and tools. This may seem very beneficial at first, however, distance learning has certain negative aspects that should not be overlooked. Being able to attend classes from home would not be beneficial to students because this will cause a decrease in student productivity, increase chances of cheating amongÂ students, and deprive students of the discipline and social skills that a regular school environment teaches.  Students are scientifically proven to be more productive while working in places they associate with said work. A regular school environment helps students be more productive by eliminating outside distractions and helping students focus better on their work. These are conditions that simply cannot be replicated in a house environment for the student. A house is associated with relaxation, sleep, safety, and nourishment. Being in an environment like this simply doesnt help students be productive and focus. An example to this is my uncle who works in the I.T field. He used to work from home for a long time, giving advice to companies about their online systems and programs. He switched to working in an office two years ago and saw a major increase in his productivity. He said having a designated place to work helps get in a working mindset which directly translates to more work being done. The working environment a school provides for its students is an essential part of education and shouldnt be eliminated through distance learning.  Cheating and plagiarismÂ are major issues that are being fought against all over the country. Every school district wants to combat cases of cheating as much as they can. Many guidelines and regulations are put in place in an attempt to end this widespread phenomenon. However, offering students to attend classes from home goes against everything thats being done in order to prevent cheating. Without a teacher to supervise them, students who work from home will be much more prone to cheating on test or other assignment, which would give them an unfair edge on their peers. Last year, my math teacher gave us a take-home quiz. Her goal in doing so was to give us more time to work on it so we can work at our own pace. She did this in order for us to be more successful on the test. At first glance, it seemed like her plan was working since everyone in the class got very good scores on said assignment. However, we later found out that most people were looking up the answers online when the class average for the real test came out to be unexpectedly low. In a case like this, having students take the quiz assignment in class wouldve led them to actually learn the material instead of searching the answers up online and taking the easy way out. Most students dont put an effort to seeking out ways to cheat, but when given an easy opportunity, most of them will be prone to do so instead of trying to challenge themselves.  Along with all the academic advantages schools have over distance learning, they also provide a social environment that school age students need to be exposed to in order to develop necessary social skills. A school is the best place for students to make lifelong friends, share memorable moments with people, and go through so many more social experiences that will prepare them for adulthood. A friend of mine, who was home schooled until ninth grade, always talks about how much better a real school environment is compared to being educated at home. Because of this, hes very socially awkward and anxious around people. A distance learning program, where the student can stay home all day and isnt encouraged to go outside and socialize, is destined to result in students suffering from similar consequences.  In conclusion, technology has been useful in many aspects of our education system. This, however, doesnt mean our education should be completely dominated by technology. Schools offering students a distance learning option where they can study from home results in many problems such as lowering students work productivity, and having them be more inclined towards cheating. On top of this, distance learning eliminates the advantages of a school environment such as providing better focus and teaching students necessary social and disciplinary skills. The distance learning option may seem like a decent idea at first glance, but in its roots lie many problems that would have to be solved in order to make it beneficial.
Boom! Generic_Name kicks the soccer ball as hard as she can towards the goal. The goaly is surprised but quick on her feet as she thrusts herself towards the ball and catches it before it reaches the net. The referee blows the whistle and that is the end of the game. Generic_Name has not only let herself down, but her team as well. Each team shake hands with each other and leave the field. You have an expression on your face that describes disappointment and anger. Our schools principal, Generic_Name then looks at you from the bleachers and calls you over. As you make your way across the field, you keep yourself questioning yourself. What did I do? Am i going to be kicked off the team? Am I not good enough? Generic_Name asks you whether or not you think everybody at school should do at least one activity or sport. Generic_Name disagrees with this statement because students have after school activities they do that include sports, private lessons, and even classes.  Sports are a great way to exercise and distract yourself from school or even things that are stressful. There are different types of sports including football, soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, etc. Imagine yourself running across the field with a football. The game is about to end and you are tied with the other team 21-21. You are so close to making a touchdown when out of the corner of your eye, you see the other team sprinting toward you. You run faster and sprint across the field and make the touchdown. The score is now 22-21 as the whistle blows the end of the game. Your team picks you up and runs you across the field, yelling and screaming your name, Generic_Name! Generic_Name!. Generic_Name looks your way and smiles as your still questioning. Did I change his mind? Will students be able to make their own choices of what they want?  Private lessons is another activity that most likely will be after school. There are many lessons people take and most of them are orchestra and band lessons. Orchestra lessons include the violin, viola, cello, and bass. For example, say you play the violin and you signed up for lessons. You feel the light, warm breeze on your arms as you make your way inside. Youre then lead to a room where you see all the instruments of the orchestra. The instructor tells you to play a D major scale. As you spend an hour doing scales and playing music, youre time ran out and it is time to go home. You feel the slightest touch against your shoulder and as you turn around. The instructor is holding a music book for you to practice. You then take the book and make your way home.  Classes include usually art or wood making. In the wood making classes, youre given a block of wood and instructions that give you a task you must complete. In art classes, the instructor guides you through the process for your assignment and gives you the materials. After she tells you what your doing, youre then allowed to start on your own to accomplish the assignment. The art materials include paint, crayons, colored pencils, shading tools, chalk, paint brushes, etc. The wood making classes include a block of wood, sandpaper, and machines throughout the class to cut off a piece from the block. Generic_Name loves art and does painting herself with a paintbrush and a holder with different colored paints. Generic_Name also has an easel to hold her artwork, a stool to sit, and a basket with all her colored paints.  Students at school should have a choice on whether they want to do an activity or a sport. People cantÂ make decisions for others but they can make decisions for themselves. Generic_Name shouldnt have students pick schoolÂ activitiesÂ over after school activities. Students shouldnt have to choose something for school and have to give up something they enjoy after school for that certain activity or sport. Imagine yourself falling into a deep hole and have to decide over two things to get out. One choice you want but it will affect your life while the other choice wouldnt but you would not enjoy it. How would you feel? What would you choose? I disagree with this statement because many students have after school activities that may include sports, private lessons, and classes that they enjoy and are not ready to give up yet.Â 
Title: The Impact of School Schedules on Energy Conservation  As an 8th grader, I have learned about the importance of conserving energy and resources in our daily lives. Many businesses have adopted various strategies to reduce their energy consumption, such as using LED light bulbs, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and implementing energy-efficient HVAC systems. However, I wonder if these efforts are enough to make a significant impact on the environment. In this essay, I will evaluate the effectiveness of a four-day work week in conserving energy and resources, discuss the potential consequences of extending the school day by two hours, and examine how students and teachers time is used when attending school five days per week for eight hours.  Firstly, a four-day work week has been shown to be an effective way to conserve energy and resources. By reducing the number of working days, businesses can significantly reduce their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study by the University of Warwick, a four-day work week can lead to a 10% reduction in energy use and a 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, employees have more time to spend on leisure activities, which can lead to a healthier work-life balance and a reduced carbon footprint.  However, extending the school day by two hours may not be as effective in conserving energy and resources. While this may provide more time for students to learn and teachers to teach, it can also lead to increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, schools consume a significant amount of energy, with the average school building using 20% of the districts total energy budget. By extending the school day, schools may need to increase their energy consumption, which can offset any potential gains in energy conservation.  Furthermore, attending school five days per week for eight hours can be detrimental to students and teachers time. Students may feel overwhelmed with the amount of homework and extracurricular activities, leading to increased stress levels and decreased motivation. Teachers may also feel burnt out from the long school days, which can negatively impact their ability to teach and engage with students. By att
Limiting car usage is a good idea. Limiting cars usage it a wonderful idea for many reasons. most people have the ability to live there life without cars, this would help cut back on pollution, and for most people it would be cheaper. Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not.  To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run out of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want.  Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad pollution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide pollution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutants and it causes lot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas.  Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there licenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas.  Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper.
 Do we ever feel surprised when peoples behavior changes over time? This is because our first impressions of them can be difficult to change. While it is true that people can change, it is also true that their behavior is often influenced by their first impressions. This is why it is important to be cautious when judging people based on their initial behavior.  First impressions are not always accurate, and people can change their behavior for a variety of reasons. For example, a person may act a certain way in order to impress someone or to achieve a specific goal. This is not necessarily a reflection of their true character. Additionally, people may change their behavior due to external factors such as stress, depression, or poverty. These factors can affect a persons behavior and make it difficult for them to act in a way that is consistent with their true character.  It is also important to remember that people can change their behavior for the better or for the worse. For example, a person who was once very shy may become more outgoing and confident with time. On the other hand, a person who was once very confident may become more reserved and cautious. It is up to each individual to decide how they want to change their behavior and to work towards making those changes.  It is important to approach people with an open mind and to be willing to see them in a new light. This means being patient and understanding when someones behavior changes, and not jumping to conclusions about their character based on their initial impressions. Instead, we should strive to get to know people on a deeper level and to form our opinions about them based on our experiences with them over time.  In conclusion, peoples behavior can change over time, and it is important to be aware of this when forming our opinions about them. While first impressions can be difficult to change, people can change their behavior for a variety of reasons, and it is up to each individual to decide how they want to change their behavior. By approaching people with an open mind and being willing to see them in a new light, we can form more accurate and positive opinions about them.
 I believe that extending the school day by two hours can be a negative decision, as not all students agree with it and it can be a complex issue. For some students, it may be difficult to adjust to the longer school day, especially if they have other commitments in the afternoon.  On the other hand, I think that the benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week can be positive and negative. While some students may appreciate the shorter school week, others may feel that it is too short and that they are not getting enough education. Additionally, the four-day school week can also have negative consequences, such as students staying out too late and not getting enough rest.  In my opinion, it is important to consider the needs and preferences of all students when making decisions about school schedules. While some students may benefit from a longer school day, others may not, and it is important to find a balance that works for everyone.  Ultimately, I believe that it is better to err on the side of caution and not make any drastic changes to the school schedule without fully considering the potential consequences. Instead, it is important to gather input from students, teachers, and parents and work together to find a solution that is fair and equitable for all.
Working in a group is a common practice in many aspects of life, from school to work. While some may argue that working alone is more effective, the benefits of working in a group are numerous and varied. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of working in a group, both academically and socially. I will provide examples of how working in groups can be beneficial in class and in life. I will also analyze the potential challenges and provide solutions on how to overcome them.  One of the most significant benefits of working in a group is the opportunity for collaboration. When working in a group, individuals can share their ideas and work together to create a solution. This can lead to more creative and innovative ideas than working alone. For example, in class, working in a group can lead to more comprehensive and well-rounded projects. When students work together, they can combine their strengths and complement each others weaknesses. This can lead to a more successful project.  Another benefit of working in a group is the opportunity for socialization. When working in a group, individuals can learn from and interact with people from different backgrounds. This can lead to new friendships and a broader perspective on the world. For example, in a group project at work, individuals from different departments can collaborate and learn from each other. This can lead to better communication and understanding between departments, which can ultimately benefit the company.  However, working in a group can also present challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the potential for conflict. When working in a group, individuals may have different opinions or ideas about how to approach a problem. This can lead to disagreements and tension within the group. To overcome this challenge, it is essential to establish clear communication and set ground rules for group discussions. This can help to ensure that everyones voice is heard and that conflicts are resolved in a respectful and productive manner.  Another challenge of working in a group is the potential for unequal contributions. Some individuals may take on more responsibility or contribute more than others, leading to feelings of frustration and resentment. To overcome this challenge, it is essential to establish clear roles and responsibilities for each member of the group. This can help to ensure that everyone is contributing to the groups success and that no one feels left behind.  In conclusion, working in a group has numerous benefits, both academically and socially. The
Hey, yall! ð Today, Im gonna write about two types of traits that are super important in life: being unique and fitting in. ð¤ I know, I know, its like, totally clichÃ©, but bear with me, kay? ð  So, first off, being unique means being different from everyone else. Its like, having your own style, your own personality, and your own way of doing things. Its when you dont try to be like everyone else, but instead, you embrace who you are and let your freak flag fly! ð³ï¸âð Its like, when youre the kid in class who always wears bright colors and crazy hairstyles, and you dont care what anyone else thinks! ð  But, on the other hand, fitting in is like, being part of the crowd. Its when you dress like everyone else, talk like everyone else, and do things like everyone else. Its when you dont want to stand out or be different, cause youre afraid of what others might think. ð¤·ââï¸ Its like, when youre the kid in class who always wears the same uniform and tries to blend in with the crowd. ð´  Now, heres the thing: our choices influence others, whether we want them to or not! ð¤¯ Like, if youre the kid who always stands out and does things differently, you might inspire others to do the same! ð¡ And if youre the kid who always fits in and does things the same way as everyone else, you might set the trend for everyone else! ðââï¸  So, heres my argument: we should stand out for ourselves! ðª Its important to be true to ourselves and not try to be like everyone else, cause being unique is what makes us special. ð¥ Its like, when youre the only one who can do something, youre the best at it! ð And when you
Texting and Driving  In the society of today, everyone is easily distracted when they get a notification on their phones. Which can lead to some funny stuff like running into a pole or a wall. But it can also lead to the end of someones life.  The average person drives 70 mph on the highway, and if a person were to look away for 5 seconds they would have traveled 102.7 feet. That is more than a quarter of a football field. By that time anything couldve happened that would lead them to an accident. Each year, over 390,000 accidents caused by texting and driving leads to severe injuries such as broken bones, neck and back injuries, traumatic brain injuries, etc. For example, in 2013 a 22 year-old man named Alexander Heit flipped his car and rolled for a while. He died while typing a text to his friend.  Because of all the deaths and injuries caused by texting while driving, most states in the United States have made laws to try to make the road a safer place. The first offense you will be charged with a misdemeanor and can get a ticket that ranges from $25 to $50 and one on their driver license. And it just gets worse from there on out if they continue violating the law. But if you were to kill someone while texting and driving, you will be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter and can spend up to 20 years in prison. Although all of these precautions have been made, accidents are still growing.  The states of Missouri and Montana do not have laws to regulate texting while driving even after all of the accidents caused by it. I honestly think that there should be harsher laws for people texting while driving. It so saddening to hear that someone lost their life over a text that could have waited till later. Something needs to happen so that all of these deaths stop.         
January 27, 2011  Dear Principals,  You know how these texting in class and calling and being not responsible... Well I think that policy 2 is the best policy. This reason is because students can be more focused on their work more than phones , students want be distracting other kids , and most importantly is that they need to have a good GED when they get in high school. I think we should have a election. I know back in a few grades I used to text and everything but I have learned my lesson. I have had bad grades and you dont want that. But the main thing im trying to get to here is that, texting should not be allowed in class like what policy two said. I think that is jus plain dumb. Im just trying to persuade you to not let texting go on during class. Also im conserned about my other class mates.  Well I hope if anyone else writes you . That they feel the same way I do . Well got to get back to my school work. That is whats best for me!  Your Friend, STUDENT_NAME
Hey there!  So, you know how people always say you are who you surround yourself with? Like, your friends, family, and even celebrities you look up to? Yeah, I totally get it now. Like, I used to think it was just a cliche, but then I realized its actually really true.  Take, like, my best friend Sarah. Shes always been super into art, and I used to think it was just a phase or something. But then she started taking classes and getting really good at it, and now she wants to be an artist when she grows up. And its not just her, like, my parents are always talking about how they want to travel more and see new places, and now Im like, Yeah, I want to travel too!  But then there are people who dont have as much influence, like my cousin John. Hes always been really into sports, but his parents are always pushing him to be a doctor or something, and now hes like, Ugh, I dont even want to play sports anymore. And its not just him, like, I know people who have given up on their dreams because they didnt have anyone to support them.  Its like, if you dont have anyone to believe in you, or push you to reach your goals, youll never achieve them. And thats why its so important to surround yourself with people who will support you and help you reach your full potential. Like, I know Im not going to be a professional artist or anything, but I at least want to try and pursue my passion, you know?  So yeah, I guess what Im trying to say is that peoples examples and past experiences can have a huge impact on the decisions and goals of others. And its not just about being influenced by the right people, its about being influenced by people who will help you reach your full potential.  Oh, and one more thing. Like, have you ever heard of the saying you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with? Its like, think about it, if you spend all your time with people who are lazy and don
Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky and human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venuss knickname is sometimes called the Evening Star mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely.  It is also called the Evening Star because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth.  These conditions are far more extreme than anything human would encounter on Earth.  It is not suprising that the temperature average is so high given the fact that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. So basically, if you walk on Venus you will get burns.  Studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky because it is simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.  Yes, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely, but although it is not clear due to the fact that 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, it is still simple to see from the distant, safe vantage point.  No spacecraft survived for more than a few hours because of the carbon dioxide blanketing clouds of Venus.  The clouds of Venus most likely explains why not a single spacecraft torched down on Venus for more than three decades. Venuss atmosphere at night is not affected by carbon dioxide of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. This is exactly why studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky is simple for an amateur stargazer to spot.  Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.  Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.  Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.  This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.  So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel.  So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers.  So, If Venus was more of a dangerous planet to explore, walk on, and study, would this be a planet that everyone would be interested to study and afraid to walk on to explore?  
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I have been informed that you like the idea of community service.  I also think it is a good deed and does help our city in may ways.  I have in the past performed community service and i did enjoy it. it has been brought to my attention that you would like all student to be required to perform community service.  I believe this is a very good idea and that this can help kids have more pride of their community.  Some of my fellow classmates do not think community service would be good.  They believe this would take away some of their time to do things they want to do.  This may be true, but a little time for community service wouldnt hurt anyone.  Also, community service can vary in different ways.  Some forms can be tutoring or teaching, and other can be cleaning or picking up litter and even volunteering.  I do believe community service would be a good requirement for students. It could them out of trouble and could even help the people in our city.  I do believe however there should also be a small reward for their deeds. This could make kids want to help out more if they know there is a reward for their hard work.  Another benefit of community service is that it can help you in the future.  Volunteering can help you get into a better college or help you when applying for scholarships.  In conclusion, my opinion would be to require some form of community service, there are many rewards that come out of helping another person or your own city.  I find this would be a very rewarding idea, and volunteering could also help someone in there future. This idea is very good one and should be made a requirement for the years to come.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME
Driverless cars isnt safe baceuse there are to may things that can go wrong.  Or someone could get badly injured or even die from a drivless car.  And in the article it also says what car is really the safest. The only safe car has human control at all times.And if there was an accident with one of these car going wrong it would be extremly hard to find whos fault it really is. It also says in the articel that  If the technology fails and someone getting injured,who is at fault the driver or the manufacture.That is why in most places in the United States baned people from testing these cars.In most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars. So really these cars is a big accident waiting to happen And the only person peopel can blame is the driver for buying the driver less car.  That is why I would not buy or drive one of these cars because there unsafe and dangorious to the public.
 Dear, Dr. Generic_Name  Thank you for considering my letter. I hope it finds you well. I am currently a junior at Generic_School. I strongly believe that students should commit to a career path at a young age because it allows them to explore their creativity and passions, and have a head start on making informed decisions about their future.  Firstly, I would like to discuss the creative potential that students possess in their careers. When students are given the opportunity to explore their interests and passions, they are able to express themselves in unique and innovative ways. For example, as an artist, I love to use my creativity to express my emotions and ideas through my work. If I didnt start thinking about my career path at a young age, I may not have discovered my passion for art and may have missed out on the opportunity to pursue it professionally.  Additionally, committing to a career path at a young age allows students to have a head start on making informed decisions about their future. By starting to research and explore different career options, students are able to gain a better understanding of what they want to do and what it takes to achieve their goals. This can be especially beneficial for students who may not have a clear idea of what they want to do after graduation. By starting early, students can also take advantage of resources and opportunities that may not be available later in life.  Finally, I believe that schools can play a crucial role in helping students make informed decisions about their career path. Schools can provide students with the resources and support they need to explore different options and find the right fit for their interests and passions. For example, schools can offer career counseling services, internships, and other opportunities that can help students gain valuable experience and insight into different career paths.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that students should commit to a career path at a young age. By doing so, they can explore their creativity and passions, have a head start on making informed decisions about their future, and take advantage of resources and opportunities that may not be available later in life. I hope that my thoughts on this matter have been helpful and that you will consider them when making decisions about your own career path.  Sincerely,  Generic_Name
The face on Mars was spotted by a Viking 1 spacecraft. When the spacecraft was circling the planet and snap shotting photos of landing sites for Viking 2, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The face was first dicovere in 1976. The last snapshot was taken in 2001.  Some people believe the face was made by aliens in Mars and aslo that it could possible be made by the atient Egypt. This face became a pop icon. The face has starred in Hollywood films and it has appeared in books and magazines. Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.  After all, the face is just a landform that the shadow had made it more like a face. There are no evidence where the face had other connections to be discovered. It was naturally formed by the land and the rock formation and also the shadows that made it look more like it. 
 Many individuals believe that self-esteem arises from accomplishments.  They argue that the true source of self-esteem lies in achievement.  Indeed, achieving a goal can push you to strive harder, boost your self-confidence, and provide a lasting sense of satisfaction that you can cherish for years to come.  Firstly, achieving a goal can motivate you to push yourself harder.  This is crucial because success often comes from the many small accomplishments that lead to the achievement of larger goals.  By setting and achieving smaller goals, you can build momentum and gain the confidence to tackle more significant challenges.  Secondly, achievement can help you develop a positive self-image.  When you accomplish something, you feel proud of yourself, which can help you develop a stronger sense of self-worth.  This, in turn, can help you feel more confident and motivated to achieve even more in the future.  Thirdly, achievement can provide a sense of satisfaction that can last for years.  For example, if youve been working towards a goal for a long time and finally achieve it, youll feel a sense of pride and accomplishment that can last for years to come.  This sense of satisfaction can help you maintain a positive outlook on life and give you the motivation to continue striving for success.  In conclusion, achievement is a crucial component of building self-esteem.  By setting and achieving goals, you can build confidence, develop a positive self-image, and experience a sense of satisfaction that can last for years to come.  If you want to improve your self-esteem, start by setting small goals and working towards achieving them.  With each accomplishment, youll gain the confidence and motivation to continue striving for success.
Many classes require students to complete a summer assignment that has been created by the instructor before the first day of school. The assignments promote students to maintain their critical thinking skills and learn new material during the long break. They are incredibly beneficial to students because they prepare them for the classes they will be taking in the upcoming year. However, many pupils dread completing their teacher-designed summer assignments since summer is a time when students are supposed to have more freedom in choosing how to spend their time. Although teacher-designed summer projects provide students more insight on the format of the work they will be receiving throughout the year, summer projects should be student-designed because they would give students more creative freedom, grow skills necessary to success, and allow teachers to learn more about their students.  The freedoms offered to students are very limited at schools. Children are often reprimanded harshly when they do not comply to specific instructions. While some argue that this method of educating produces obedient and respectful citizens, it leads to the suppression of creativity and students feeling as if they do not have a voice in their own education. Giving students the opportunity to design their own summer projects would incorporate some much needed creativity into standard school curriculum by promoting students to think abstractly and do beyond what is required of them. They get very few chances to pursue their passions and expand their knowledge beyond what is expected of them during the school year, so a student-designed project would empower them to think for themselves and take control of their education. Additionally, boredom during school and over the summer is extremely prevalent in young adults and children. A project that pupils could design on their own would entice them to deeply explore the topics they are interested in. Giving them more liberty in their projects would encourage them to get excited about what they are learning and provide them with more control over their own lives.  Student-designed projects would force students to grow their skills that are useful in the workforce and society. The American education system was designed during a time when the nation was industrializing, therefore much of the curriculum taught to children reflects the need of that time period for workers that areÂ obedientÂ and can follow instructions clearly. Education should coincide with current society standards and currently, creativity and innovation is highly valued in the workforce. Yet, young Americans rarely have the opportunity to grow the skills needed to be successful in the modern workforce. Implementing the use of projects designed by students would urge children to utilize the crucial asset of being able to do more than solely follow directions. A large proportion of students also lack the ability to proficiently manage their time and maintain organization. Student-designed projects would entail that students would not only complete their assignment, but create it as well. Therefore students would be forced to make a plan and spend more time on their projects. The practical skills that would be required to successfully complete a student-designed summer project would provide students with numerous long termÂ benefits.  Many teachers have the goal of getting to know their students better. Student-designed assignments would help facilitate that goal. It is a challenge for many teachers to develop an understanding of the interests of each of their students, especially in the beginning of the school year. Also, standardized testing and standards-based learning has dramatically reduced the variety of teaching styles that teachers implement. While the standardization of education helps officials assess educators and recognize struggling students, it operates under the false assumption that every child functions and learns in the same fashion. In contrast to testing and teaching every pupil the same way, for a project created by students, children would be able to choose the methods they take to understand material. When teachers review the work of their young scholars, they will be able to recognize how they chose to learn, making it easier to cater to that students needs throughout the year. Students often contain very bright and innovative ideas, and teachers could learn a great deal from their students. Allowing students to design their own projects would give teachers the opportunity to utilize some of their students effective ideas and incorporate them into their own teaching. Teachers would be able to see trends in what their children are interested in and what helps them retain content. Educators deserve to gain more knowledge about their students and receive new ideas that they can include in the classroom that would help students learn in a more engaging way that suits their needs.  Summer projects should be student-designed because these projects would provide students with an increase in opportunities to think creatively, assist them in developing new useful skills, and give teachers more tools to ensure their students success. Completing assignments for school are often a bleak part of a young students summer. Utilizing student-designed projects would encourage students to continue learning over break with enthusiasm and would improve the quality of their educational experience.
Limiting car usages will cause a drop in the amount of pollution there is. Â In source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, on mondays, motorist with an even numbered license plate will have to leave their car home or have a 22 euro fine. The odd numbered plates would be the next day and so on. Â Using this way of driving, it reduced the number of congestion in the capital city of France by 60 percent.  Some places in Germany areÂ catching on and making a comunity free of cars. Â Residents of VAUBAN, Germany like the way this community is set up. When I had a car I was always tense. Â Im much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter. Â All they hear is the swish of bicycles and the talk of children drowns out the occasioal distant motor. Â Many places around this world is adopting this act.  In BOGOTA, Colombia a program started for a car-free-day. Â Only buses and taxis are allowed to be driven. Â Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Â People who didnt participate suffered a 25 dollar fine. Â Bogota made 118 miles of bike paths since the car-free-day.  By driving cars everywhere we are polluting mother earth. Â We all need to get together and stop driving so much and this will help protect our Earth.    
Knowledge vs. Imagination: Which is More Important?  As an 8th grader, I believe that knowledge is more important than imagination. While imagination can be a powerful tool for creativity and problem-solving, knowledge provides a solid foundation for making informed decisions and achieving success in life.  Firstly, knowledge is essential for understanding the world around us. It helps us learn about different cultures, histories, and scientific principles, which are crucial for making informed decisions and navigating the complexities of life. For instance, knowing about different cultures can help us appreciate and respect the diversity of people, while understanding history can help us learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them. Similarly, scientific knowledge can help us develop new technologies and solve real-world problems. Without knowledge, we would be like blindfolded travelers, stumbling through life without a clear understanding of where we are going.  Secondly, knowledge is more reliable than imagination. While imagination can be used to create fantastical stories and scenarios, it is often based on unreliable assumptions and biases. In contrast, knowledge is based on evidence and facts, which can be verified and tested. For example, imagine a person who has never traveled outside of their hometown and has only read about different countries in a textbook. They may have vivid imaginative scenarios of what these countries are like, but without actual experience, their imagination is limited and unreliable. On the other hand, someone who has traveled to multiple countries and has firsthand experience can provide a more accurate and reliable account of what these countries are really like.  Finally, knowledge is more practical than imagination. While imagination can be used to create artistic works and entertainment, it is often limited to the realm of fantasy. In contrast, knowledge can be applied to real-world problems and situations, making it more practical and useful. For instance, knowing how to solve a math problem or how to fix a car can be much more practical than imagining a fantastical world where cars can fly.  In conclusion, while imagination can be a valuable tool for creativity and problem-solving, knowledge is more important for understanding the world around us, making informed decisions, and achieving success in life. While imagination can be unreliable and limited
Achieving goals is a crucial part of life, and its something that students at every age should learn about. For elementary school students, setting and achieving goals can be a challenging but rewarding experience. In this presentation, I will discuss the key points of achieving goals and provide some tips on how to set and achieve them.  The first step in achieving a goal is to set it. This may seem like an obvious step, but its essential to take the time to think about what you want to achieve. When setting a goal, its important to make it specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This will help you stay focused and motivated as you work towards your goal.  For example, if you want to improve your reading skills, your goal could be to read a certain number of books or to improve your reading speed. By making your goal specific, you can create a clear plan for how to achieve it.  Once youve set your goal, the next step is to stay motivated. Motivation can be tricky, especially for young students who may not have a lot of life experience. One way to stay motivated is to remind yourself of why you set the goal in the first place. For example, if your goal is to improve your reading skills, you may be motivated by the desire to read more interesting books or to impress your teachers.  Another way to stay motivated is to break your goal down into smaller, more manageable steps. This will help you feel like youre making progress towards your goal, even if it seems like a long way away.  Finally, its important to remember that achieving a goal can be difficult and that its okay to not give up. Its normal to encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way, but its important to keep pushing forward. One way to do this is to seek help from others. Whether its a teacher, parent, or friend, having someone to support you and offer advice can be incredibly helpful.  In conclusion, achieving goals is an important part of life, and its something that elementary school students should learn about. By setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals, staying motivated, and not giving up, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Remember, the journey to achieving
The author suggests that studying Venus is important for a few reasons. The first of which is that Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system. The second one is Venus could have once been able to be compatable for life. Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes. The final reason is that the author brings up the challenges that NASA is facing in trying to get to Venus. What the author is getting to is that when we finally figure out how to get to Venus this could help us get to other planets as well. That is why I think that the author wants us to study Venus.  The first of which that the author brings up is the fact that Venus is the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Venus has a rocky surface similar to that of Earths. It also has valleys, mountain, and craters all of this is similar to that of Earths and can be used to maybe help us more understand out planet. Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus is similar to Earth is that scientist believe that Venus was once covered largely with oceans. This means that their could have been life on Venus such as plants. Another thing that was brought up was in paragraph three where the author talked about how Venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes this is something that we also share with that is also happening here on Earth. If we could go to Venus and study all of that it could help us understand how to know farther ahead of time when we may have a a earthquake. The final thing that the author talks about is all of the challenges that we will face trying to get humans on the ground on Venus. The troubles that we face is the atmosphere and the pressure. These challenges make it almost impossibe for humans to withstand becase the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. So what the author is getting at is that if we are able to get through all of these challenges and get boots on the ground on Venus, it would mean that when we are to explore or study another planet we can overcome these challenges much faster.  So that is why I think that the author wants us to explore Venus. The first reason being Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system. The second one being that Venus was once able to be compatable for life. Third is that Venus experiences earthquakes and lightning striks just like Earth does. Finally the last thing that the author brings up is that going to Venus could help us travel to other planets with knowledge on how we can overcome the challenges from Venus. That is why I think that the author wants NASA to study Venus farther and learn more about it.
Hey there!  So, Im pretty sure we all know how it feels like to be bombarded with questions about our future plans. Like, What college classes are you taking? or When are you going to join the military? And honestly, it can be super stressful trying to decide on something that feels like its going to define our entire lives. But, I think its important to remember that we dont have to have it all figured out right away.  First of all, lets talk about college classes. I mean, its totally fine to take a gap year or two to figure out what we really want to study. I know some people who are super sure about their major, but Im still trying to figure out what Im even interested in. And thats okay! Its better to take some time to explore different subjects and find what truly interests us, rather than jumping into something that we might end up hating. Plus, taking elective courses gives us the chance to try out new things and discover hidden talents. Who knows, maybe well find our passion in something completely unexpected!  And dont even get me started on joining the military. I mean, its a huge commitment and its not something that we should have to decide on at such a young age. I get that its a noble and important profession, but its not something that we should rush into without giving it proper thought and consideration. Plus, there are so many other ways to make a difference in the world, like volunteering or working for a cause that were passionate about.  In conclusion, I think its important to take things at our own pace and not feel pressured to make life-altering decisions right away. Elective courses provide the perfect opportunity to explore our interests and learn what truly makes us happy. So, lets not rush into anything that were not ready for, and instead take the time to figure out what we truly want to do with our lives.  Thanks for reading! ð
Having a successful business takes more than just good ideas and hard work. Numerous factors come into play, including external factors such as the economy, which can dramatically affect a businesss success. It is therefore important to consider all possible reasons why a business could fail and devise a plan to help business owners come up with ideas to ensure success. Furthermore, those who experience failure can find solace in the stories of successful people who overcame their struggles and rose to success. A great example of this is Winston Churchill, who despite suffering many disappointments and failures in his lifetime, managed to make a huge contribution to society. This illustrates the importance of perseverance and continuing to pursue goals despite any setbacks. Equally, an effective support system is essential for those going through difficult times, providing emotional and physical assistance to those who need it.
Generic_Name  Mr. Generic_Name  English 8 Honors  March 11, 2020  Seeking Multiple Opinions on a Problem  Have you ever had a problem where you sought advise from someone else? When people have a problem often times they will ask multiple people to help them make the best choice. Asking multiple people about a problem allows you to hear multiple perspectives, since different people have had different life experiences. Usually when you are involved in a difficult situation your judgment might be clouded, asking someone outside of the issue gives you an unbiased answer. The people close to you have your best interests at heart, so when you ask them for help they are going to offer good advise. Everyone gets into situations where they do not know what to do, so when they get into those situations, they should ask the advise from multiple people around them.  Different people have been through many different things, so when you ask multiple people for advise they can offer different views and opinions. A new outlook on a problem might be just what you need to figure out the answer. For example, if you were trying to decide whether or not to get a pet, asking someone who has pets or works with animals, would give different advise and opinions than someone who doesnt like animals. Multiple opinions give us multiple ways to look at a problem, giving us multiple ways to solve that problem. Asking the opinions of multiple people, who have different things to offer, lets you look at a situation in a new way.  If you are involved in a problem that means a lot to you, the stress and intensity of the issue can cloud your judgment. Trying to solve a problem when you cant think straightÂ sets you up for making a poor choice, thats why you should ask people who are not involved. People who arent involved with the problem you are dealing with can offer opinions that you could not think of before. When couples are having a hard time and cant work it out, they sometimes go to a couples therapist, the therapist can offer them help and advise the couple couldnt have found on their own. Being part of a fight or arguments can make people want to act without thinking, that is why asking the opinions of people who are not involved can give you an unbiased opinion.  Your friends and family want you to be happy, because they have your best interests at heart. The people you surround yourself with care about you and want you to make good choices. When you ask loved ones their advise you know their response is genuine, and its what they think will help you be the pest person possible. If you are having a hard time or just need help with something, family and friends will be there to give you advise that a stranger could never offer, because your loved ones know you. Asking family and friends their opinion on a problem will allow you to make the best choice, because the people you choose to surround yourself with only want you to be happy.  Everyone gets into problems or situations they cant face on their own, thats why asking for advise from others will give you the tools needed to make the best possible choice. Asking the advice of multiple people makes it possible for you to get the perspectives of multiple people, and those perspectives will all come with their own advise to help you. Being a part of something that matters you can make you act rash or make decisions you would always make, thats why you should ask people who are unbiased, because they will give opinions that are genuine. The people around you, who care about you, will always give you advise and opinions to help you because they know and care about you. Asking for opinions from others is something everyone does, it helps us make more informed decisions and choices about our lives.

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that older students can greatly benefit younger students with school work. By working together, older students can help younger students develop valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.  One way that older students can help younger students is by pairing up with them for group projects. By working together, older students can provide guidance and support to younger students, helping them to develop their skills and confidence. This can be especially beneficial for younger students who may struggle with certain subjects or tasks, as older students can offer additional perspectives and resources to help them succeed.  In addition to working together on group projects, older students can also provide valuable advice to younger students when they need it. Whether its offering tips on how to study for exams or providing guidance on how to navigate the social landscape of school, older students can offer valuable insights and support to younger students. This can be especially beneficial for younger students who may be new to the school or who may be struggling to find their place in the community.  Overall, I believe that it is beneficial for schools to have a program that pairs up older and younger students. By working together and learning from each other, students can develop valuable skills and build strong relationships that can last a lifetime.
The advantages of limiting car usage is very important to the enviorment. The artlice clearly sates limiting car usage will have a great impact on the enviorment and make the world much more green. The reduce usage of a car will help the world in many different ways. The United States Environmental Protenction Agency wants to start a car reduced town community and have people use thier car less and less every day untill they dont use it at all. Citizens of the United States spend so much money on gas every day, every week, every month and all this money will eventually adds up throughout the year, imagine how much money you could be saving without paying for all that gas?  First off, having no car will save you thousands of dollars. You could even live a happier life, in the article it states When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). This tells you that with no car you can live a happier life, you dont need a car to be happy. Imagine being stress free, no car trouble saving money on gas? That sounds pretty amazing to me. You could have much more money in your pocket to spend on other things that maybe you could never buy when you were wasting all you money into your gas tank. Problem solved, GET RID OF YOUR CAR! To live a car free life you have to want it and stop pollting the earth.  Second of all dont you want to get rid of car trafic? Having a car doesnt benefit youat all, it only hurts you. Cars pollute the air you have to pay inurance, car payments, gas money. In the article (Paris Bans driving due to smog) states that cars are being towed and over 4,000 drivers are being fined for their car. Tweny-seven people had their cars impounded for their reacion to the fine (Paris bans drivig duet o smog). If you dont want the trouble of having your car impounded or being fined it easy to just get rid of our car your helping not only yourself but the world.  Cars are banned in Bogota, Columbia. Cars being banned in Colombia is a great thing it saves people money and helps the earth. It was the third year cars have been benned wih only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in the capital city of 7 million ( Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota). Cars leaving the streets in bogota helped out alot people dont want to be fined for having a car so why not just get rid of it. No one actually needs a car anyways you just want one so you dont have to walk places. If you need to go a long distance then just take a taxi or bus thats no hard to do. The least ou can do is walk a extra mile a day the spending tons of money on gar to drive there.  Not to forget, cars do not help the enviorment and witout them is a great impact on the earth. Its a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota). Rain shouldnt stop anyone from going to there destination riding your bike in the rain isnt hard so start doing it. Enjoy the out doors and get out frombeing couped up indoors all the time its healthy to get a little fresh air. Getting rid of our car and using a bike or even walking will help out your savings and the earth.Â     
Driverless cars in my opinion wouldnt with the people I know in my community. This is because it would take away from the the experience of being behind the wheel of a vehical. Yes driverless cars might be safer but why should they be forced to lose something that is enjoyedable to most individuals. If states just worked as hard on enforcing and finding new ways on keeping the roads safe we could avoid the dangers of human driven cars and they could still have their experience.  Personally, I could see driverless cars as a great oppurtunity to look into because it can keep the roads safe and the person behind the wheel can do whatever they would like. Therefore they should be ready to take over at anytime. I also like this idea because the passage stated that driverless cars would take half the fuel of todays taxis. There are many positives to this but I question how well the car would be able to keep the driver awake. The passage said that the car would be watching the driver to make sure theyre aware but Im afraid that some people may fall asleep not be easily awaken. Another concern I would be afraid to get into a car that relies on so much more technology. Any of the sensors cameras could mess up or even the warning displays could go wrong. This would be a big issue for me. With those concerns i also have plenty of positives with this new idea.  The passage says that theyll have to interpret the driving fun in a new way. I think that is a wonderful thought and could possibly keep someone aware if theyre into the process of being in a driverless car. Most people today love to text and multitask in the car and that can be a problem in cars which are driven only by humans. But in this case of a intergrated process would give them that option of being on devices and doing other activities becuase it would help them stay awake and could be able to take over quickly. If they find a way to make it fun and find a way to make it a enjoyable experince i think most people will be into the safer and more effiecent taxi. Overall I think this is a great idea and could possiblly be the key to keeping people safe on the roads.                  
In recent years, there have been numerous studies about the power of small acts of kindness to make a difference in someoneâs life. While the specific results vary depending on the location, behaviors studied, and population surveyed, the general consensus is that small kindnesses do, indeed, make a difference in peoples lives.   For example, studies in schools have demonstrated that offering an offender a genuine apology or giving compliments to others will often reduce the stress level for both the offender and their peers. Likewise, providing basic necessities such as food or shelter to someone in need tends to reduce feelings of isolation, which can lead to an improved outlook on life and relationships. Small acts of kindness can also help people feel connected to their communities and their fellow citizens.  Moreover, studies suggest that individuals who are on the receiving end of acts of kindness are more likely to âpay it forwardâ to others in need. This âkindness contagionâ can spread rapidly throughout families, classrooms, neighborhoods, and even countries, resulting in a positive effect.  In conclusion, small acts of kindness have been demonstrated to make a difference in someoneâs life. From reduced stress and isolation to increased feelings of connectedness and community, kindness can truly change the lives of others. So, take a moment today and show a little kindness to those around you. You never know what impact it will have.
I think that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any way while they are driving. Its really dangerous and it makes it way more likely that they will get into an accident. Like, imagine if youre driving and youre also trying to text your friend. Youre not paying attention to the road and you might not see that car in front of you stop suddenly. Then, BAM! You crash into them and its all because you were too busy texting. Its just not worth it.  And its not just texting, its also talking on the phone. Like, if youre on a call, youre still not paying attention to the road as much as you should be. You might miss a red light or a stop sign, and then you could get into an accident. Its just too risky.  I know that some people might say that its okay to use cell phones while driving because theyre really important for emergencies. But, there are other ways to handle emergencies without using your phone while driving. Like, you could pull over to the side of the road and then call for help. That way, youre not putting yourself or anyone else in danger.  So, in conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any way while they are operating a vehicle. Its just too dangerous and there are other ways to handle emergencies. We need to make sure that everyone is safe on the road, and that means putting our phones away while were driving.
Cars are not the most important thing in our lives. Although cars are helpful, not having one can help you a lot in the long run. Having a car causes so much stress worrying about the traffic if youre going to be late for work or school, gas prices are not as low as people would like. If you had to walk everywhere or ride your bike, you could be getting a lot of exercise from it. People think having a car is so important but they dont see the positive side to it.  Many people stress out if they are not going to make it to work on time because of traffic, I know that I dont make it to school on time because of all the traffic trying to get into my school is horrible. Instead of stressing out, you can just go on a calm walk or bike ride to your destination. In the article written by, Elisabeth Rosenthal, there is a quote from Heidrun Walter saying, when I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way, because they had banned cars in his city. You can always find an alternative way of getting to where you need to go. If someone has a meeting to go to, they can always use the alternative of the Internet if they cant get their in time or the weather is not the best. Instead of stressing out about driving, you can walk to your destination and save money from not paying for gas.  We all know that gas prices are high and out of our budget. Theyve reached four dollars, thats insane! Why would anyone want to spend that money if they dont have to. There is a simple solution on saving your money that you waste on gas, and that is walking or riding your bike. Some people can afford the prices of gas but others are struggling in the economy but are to lazy to walk, nobody wants to get exercise so they drive everywhere.  Banning cars on the street is a good way to help people get exercise. If they know they cant drive, they would obviously walk or take a bike because they have places to be. It would be an effective way to get people to stop being lazy and helping their health. Some people would probably get frustrated because they have to walk everywhere but its only helping them.  Walking or riding a bike is a good opportunity to realize the beauty of life without stressing out over bad drivers or traffic, saving money, and getting exercise. Most people would think banning cars on the street is a good idea for those few reasons. I know that it is super effective although some people may not see it until it actually changes.    
Hey, Im just a regular 8th grader, so bear with me! ð  So, the question is, what happens when we give students four days to learn stuff versus five days? Its like, really interesting, you know? Like, I mean, I think its pretty cool to think about how it could affect our after-school activities, and our brains, and stuff. ð§ ð«  So, if we have four days to learn, its like, we might not have as much time to do other stuff we like, like play sports or hang out with friends. And that could be, like, really hard, you know?

I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. however, i can provide a sample argumentative essay to help you understand how to approach the prompt.  driverless cars: a dangerous experiment   the development of driverless cars is a controversial issue that has sparked heated debates across the globe. while some people see it as a technological breakthrough that will revolutionize transportation, others view it as a dangerous experiment that could lead to disastrous consequences. after reading the article driverless cars are coming, i firmly believe that we should halt the development of these cars to avoid putting human lives at risk.  to begin with, one of the most significant concerns regarding driverless cars is their safety. according to the article, these vehicles rely on sophisticated software and sensors to navigate the roads, and any malfunction could lead to severe accidents. for example, in 2018, a self-driving uber car hit and killed a pedestrian in arizona, highlighting the dangers of this technology. additionally, hackers could exploit the software vulnerabilities of driverless cars, causing them to crash or be used as weapons. these safety risks are simply too high to ignore.  moreover, driverless cars could lead to massive job losses in the transportation sector, such as taxi and truck drivers. the article mentions that these vehicles could reduce the need for human drivers, potentially leaving millions of people unemployed. this would have a devastating impact on the economy and the livelihoods of many families.  lastly, the cost of developing and implementing driverless cars is astronomical, and taxpayers would likely bear the brunt of these expenses. the article notes that companies such as google and uber have spent billions of dollars on this technology, and governments would need to invest heavily in infrastructure to support these vehicles. this money could be better spent on improving public transportation or addressing other critical societal issues.  in conclusion, driverless cars are a dangerous experiment that could have severe consequences for human safety, employment, and the economy. while some may argue that this technology could lead to fewer accidents and reduced traffic, the risks far outweigh any potential benefits. we should focus our resources on improving existing transportation systems rather than gambling on an untested and potentially deadly innovation.

My name is Luke and Im going to tell you a couple reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam. It allows you to go to different places around the world. For example, you could go to Greece and see the Acropolis. I turned 18 before we arrived at Greece, which ment I could be drafted for military service. They told me to just keep working on the cattle boat, and that would count as my service.  Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program means you also get to work with animals. Some of the animals you get to work with are horses, young cows, and mules. It can take a while to get to our destination. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China!  The Seagoing Cowboys program can be very fun. Sometimes, the cowboys play games, such as, baseball, volleyball, and table tennis. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun, but it can be dangerous at times. On my second trip across the Atlantic Ocean as a cowboy, I was a night watchman. I was supposed to check on the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making my hourly report, I slipped down a ladder. My feet shot toward an opening on the side of the ship.  If there wasnt a strip of metal that caught my side, I wouldnt be here today. I couldnt work for a while because i broke a few ribs. I thought that was fine, because I was still alive. Im very grateful for the opporrtunity, because it made me aware of people in other countries and their needs. Its a wonderful expierence helping someone in need. See their face light up when you help them makes you feel amazing. Im proud to be a Seagoing Cowboy. 
Dear Principal,  I am writing to you about the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. I believe that this policy change would be unfair to many students who have a grade C average.  First of all, not all students are good at academics. Some students may struggle with certain subjects, but they may excel in sports or other activities. These students should not be punished for their academic struggles by being denied the opportunity to participate in activities they enjoy.  Secondly, many students use sports and other activities as a way to improve their grades. If they are not allowed to participate, they may lose motivation to do well in school. This could lead to a decline in their grades, which would be counterproductive to the goal of the policy change.  Lastly, sports and other activities are important for the social and emotional development of students. They provide a way for students to make friends, learn teamwork and leadership skills, and improve their self-confidence. Denying students the opportunity to participate in these activities could have negative effects on their overall well-being.  In conclusion, I believe that the policy change requiring a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities would be unfair to many students. It would not only punish students for their academic struggles but also have negative effects on their motivation, grades, and overall well-being. I urge you to consider the potential consequences of this policy change and find alternative ways to encourage academic success among students.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
Title: The Importance of Math in My Everyday Life  Math, a subject often feared and disliked by many, is an essential tool that we use in our daily lives without even realizing it. From simple tasks like calculating change to complex problems like solving for x in an equation, math is everywhere. As an 8th grader, I have come to realize the significance of math in my daily life and how it has helped me in various ways.  Math has been an important part of my life since I was a kid. My parents always encouraged me to practice my math skills, which helped me develop a strong foundation in the subject. I remember doing math problems with my mom during breakfast every morning, and she would always praise me for my efforts. Even now, I use math in my everyday life, from calculating my allowance to balancing my checkbook.  There are numerous places where I use math in my daily life. One of the most common places is when Im shopping. I use math to calculate the total cost of items I want to buy, including taxes and discounts. For example, when I go to the grocery store, I use math to compare prices of different brands of the same product and choose the one that gives me the best value.  Another place where I use math is when Im playing sports. I play soccer, and I use math to keep track of the score, the number of minutes played, and the number of goals scored. I also use math to calculate my shooting percentage and my passing accuracy, which helps me improve my game.  Lastly, math is essential in my schoolwork. I use math to solve problems, complete assignments, and study for tests. I find that math helps me understand complex concepts better and makes it easier for me to learn new things.  In addition to these everyday applications, math can also help prepare me for success in the future. Math is a universal language that is used in many fields, including science, technology, engineering, and finance. Being proficient in math can open up many career opportunities and help me succeed in whatever path I choose to pursue.  However, I know that not everyone sees math in the same light as I do. Some people may find it boring or difficult, and they may struggle to understand its
The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a revolutionary technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. The technology uses cameras to capture facial expressions and then uses algorithms to analyze the muscle movements of the face to determine the emotion being expressed. In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author describes how this technology is being used in various settings, including classrooms, to read the emotional expressions of students. While some may argue that this technology is valuable in the classroom, I believe that it raises several concerns and is not worth implementing.  Firstly, the use of FACS in the classroom raises concerns about privacy. Students have a right to privacy, and using cameras to monitor their facial expressions without their consent is an invasion of that privacy. Imagine being a student, sitting in a classroom, and knowing that a camera is recording your every facial movement. This would be unsettling and could potentially create a hostile learning environment. Additionally, the technology is not foolproof, and there is a risk of misinterpretation. A student may be mislabeled as expressing a certain emotion when, in fact, they are simply yawnin g or stretching their face. This could lead to incorrect assumptions being made about a students emotional state and could potentially cause more harm than good.  Furthermore, the use of FACS in the classroom could create a culture of surveillance. Teachers and administrators may use the technology to monitor students emotions and then use that information to make decisions about their education. This could lead to a lack of trust between teachers and students, and could potentially stifle creativity and critical thinking. Students may feel that they are being watched and judged at all times, rather than feeling safe and supported in their learning environment.  Another concern is that the technology may be used to pathologize normal childhood behaviors. Children and teenagers experience a range of emotions throughout the day, and these emotions are a normal part of their development. However, the use of FACS could lead to over-diagnosis and over-treatment of students who are simply expressing normal emotions. This could result in unnecessary interventions and labeling of students, which could have long-term effects on their self-esteem and well-being.  Finally, the use of FACS in the classroom may not be effective in improving student outcomes. While the technology may be able to identify emotions, it does not address the root causes of those emotions. For example, if a student is expressing signs of boredom or disengagement, the technology may simply identify those emotions without addressing the underlying reasons for them. In order to truly support students, teachers need to create engaging and meaningful learning experiences that meet their individual needs. The use of FACS does not replace the need for effective teaching and learning strategies.  In conclusion, the use of FACS in the classroom raises several concerns about privacy, surveillance, pathologization, and effectiveness. While the technology may seem like a valuable tool in theory, its implementation in the classroom is not worth the potential risks. Instead, we should focus on creating supportive and engaging learning environments that meet the individual needs of all students.
Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and with the current pandemic, it has become the norm for many students. While some may argue that traditional classroom learning is better, distance learning has its own set of benefits that make it an attractive option for students. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of distance learning for students, specifically in terms of convenience in terms of transportation, food, and freedom to choose between activities.  One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the convenience it provides in terms of transportation. Students no longer have to worry about waking up early to catch the bus or drive to school. Instead, they can learn from the comfort of their own home, which eliminates the need for transportation altogether. This is especially beneficial for students who live in rural areas or have limited access to public transportation. For example, a student living in a small town may not have access to a bus or train, making it difficult for them to attend traditional classes. With distance learning, they can learn from anywhere, at any time, without the need for transportation.  Another benefit of distance learning is the convenience it provides in terms of food. Traditional classroom learning often requires students to pack a lunch or snack to bring to school. This can be inconvenient for students who may not have time to prepare a meal or who may not have access to a refrigerator or microwave at school. With distance learning, students can learn from the comfort of their own home, which means they can prepare their own meals and snacks. This is especially beneficial for students who may have dietary restrictions or who may not have access to healthy food options at school.  Finally, distance learning provides students with the freedom to choose between activities. Traditional classroom learning often requires students to attend class at specific times and participate in certain activities. This can be limiting for students who may have other commitments or who may not be interested in certain subjects. With distance learning, students can learn at their own pace and choose the activities they want to participate in. This is especially beneficial for students who may have other commitments, such as a part-time job or extracurricular activities.  In conclusion, distance learning has its own set of benefits that make it an attractive option for students. It provides convenience in terms of transportation, food, and freedom to choose between activities. While traditional classroom learning may have its own set of benefits,
Thomas Jefferson, one of Americas founding fathers, famously said, I have not failed. Ive just found 10,000 ways that wont work. This statement highlights the importance of taking action in order to achieve ones goals. Without taking action, it is impossible to succeed.  Taking action can be helpful in planning, achieving, and completing future goals in many ways. For example, when planning a goal, taking action can help identify potential obstacles and challenges that may arise. This can help individuals prepare for these obstacles and develop strategies to overcome them. Additionally, taking action can help individuals stay motivated and focused on their goals. When individuals see progress towards their goals, they are more likely to continue working towards them.  However, some may argue that staying idle can be beneficial in achieving goals. For example, taking a break from actively working on a goal can allow individuals to recharge and come back to it with fresh ideas. Additionally, some may argue that taking action can lead to burnout and exhaustion, which can hinder progress towards goals.  Despite these counterarguments, taking action can be crucial in improving study habits and being successful. When individuals take action in their studies, they are more likely to engage with the material and retain information. This can lead to better grades and a stronger understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, taking action in studying can help individuals develop good time management skills, which can be beneficial in other areas of life.  In conclusion, taking action is essential in achieving ones future goals. By identifying potential obstacles, staying motivated, and improving study habits, individuals can increase their chances of success. While staying idle may have some benefits, it ultimately leads to a lack of progress and missed opportunities. As Thomas Jefferson once said, I have not failed. Ive just found 10,000 ways that wont work. By taking action, individuals can find the path to success and achieve their goals.
